The prophet (pbuh) once said that whoever memorizes all of Allah's 99 names and then applies them in his life will be guaranteed paradise. Everybody online keeps saying that this is daunting task, but then they turn around and reveal that they're already hafizes. You don't need to be a hafiz to memorize the 99 names of Allah. You just need to be consistent and have a good memory technique. Here's how I did it in one month:

## How memory works: The memory palace technique

All humans can use science to memorize anything in life. Any information you use on a daily basis will be retained if you keep coming back to that information, and it'll take longer to forget over time. This is the concept of **spaced repetition**.

We'll define a few important terms right now:

- **Spaced repetition**: The idea that you should review information at increasing intervals to retain it in your memory.
- **Active recall**: The idea that you should actively try to remember information rather than passively re-reading it. Testing yourself is the best way to remember information.
- **short term memory**: The memory that you use to remember things for a short period of time. This is the memory that you use to remember a phone number for a few seconds.
- **long term memory**: The memory that you use to remember things for a long period of time. This is the memory that you use to remember your own birthday.

Here is the basic formula of learning:

> Constantly repeating short term memory using active recall to make it long term memory, and then using spaced repetition over time to keep it in long term memory.

This works great for 99% of learning, but what if you want to do something arbitrary like memorize the order of cards? This is where the memory palace technique comes in:

Our mind uses our senses to remember information. I bet you could remember what your favorite meal smells and tastes like, even without looking at it. You know what an elephant looks like, even without seeing it right in front of you.

What if we use our sense of vision to brand memories into our brain?

The memory palace technique uses this concept to remember information. You create a mental image of a place that you know well, like your house, and then you place the information you want to remember in that place. When you want to remember the information, you just walk through the place in your mind and you'll remember the information.

More generally, by just associating a word with something visual or familiar, we are more likely to remember it.

### Summary of learning principles

The most important part of learning is to keep consistent and keep it small. **Myelination** is the act of making certain neurons in your brain faster and stronger by strengthening the connections between them (by strengthening the myelin sheath, for the nerds out there). This is how you get better at anything in life. The more you practice, the better you get. However, if you don't practice, you will get worse and forget how to do the tasks you once learned/memorized how to do. Man, can't we have anything in life?

Luckily, it's possible to prevent forgetting how to do something. When you engage in an activity over a long period of time, like weeks or months, the myelination grows stronger and is more resistant to growing weaker. If you don't use it, then you'll lose it. Even if you only do 5 minutes a day, then each day you'll have prevented the forgetting stage of learning.

Think about it like working out - if you don't use your muscles, they'll atrophy. If you use them everyday (as long as you don't overdo it), you'll keep your muscles and they may even grow stronger.

The best way to myelinate is to use active recall, since struggling to remember information distresses your brain and gives it a signal, something like "Wow, this guy really wants to learn this. This is uncomfortable. I need to remember this information".

Myelination doesn't happen overnight however. It happens everyday, after sleep. Even if you only do a little everyday, you'll myelinate the neurons that you used that day. This is why it's important to keep consistent. If you only do a lot once a week, you won't myelinate. Work a little, and then sleep. I can't understate how important this is.

:::tip
Be consistent and small. Just 5 minutes a day is 400% better than 1 hour once a week. Use neurobiology to your advantage.

But if you don't know how to put this into practice yet, don't worry. I'll show you how I used this technique, step by step.

## The steps

The philosophy to memorize all 99 names is simple: Memorize the names in an exact order, and learn their meanings at the same time.

You must memorize the 99 names in an exact order - you can't just go in any arbitrary order. This is because the memory palace technique relies on you remembering the order of the information. If you don't remember the order, then you won't remember the information.

Think about how people remember all the Pokemon or all the songs in an album - they can't just rattle off what comes to mind. You start with the first one, and then you go down the list. This is how you remember the 99 names of Allah.

Anyway, here's the routine:

1. Go to the [Allah's names](https://myislam.org/99-names-of-allah/) site and pick the next 5 words to memorize.
2. Go to ChatGPT and ask it to explain to you the meaning behind each name. Use this to understand the name on a deep level.
3. Create 5 new flashcards. On the front, write the name. On the back, write the meaning of the name. Then create 5 more flashcards with the meanings on the front and the names on the back. This helps solidify the connections between the name and the meaning both ways.
4. Practice the flashcards until you get them all right.
5. For the first name in the series, create a mental image of the word in your mind.
6. Practice rattling off the names and their meanings in your head until you get them right 7 times in a row. You're done for the day.

I'll explain the learning techniques I used above:

- **ChatGPT**: Helps connect the name with a deeper meaning and a story behind it. This helps you remember the name better.
- **Flashcards**: Uses active recall to engrain the name's meaning in your mind quickly.
- **Mental image**: Uses the memory palace technique to remember the name in the correct order.

### Anki

Before we get into an example, I'll tell what I used for my flashcards:

Anki is a digital flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you remember information. You can create your own flashcards and then Anki will quiz you on them at increasing intervals. This is the best way to remember information in the long term.

For example, if you get a flashcard right on the first day, it'll quiz you on that the next day. Then if you get it right again, it'll quiz you 6 days later.

This perfectly follows the principle of spaced repetition and active recall. If you forget some information, then it'll be harder to remember next time. The more you struggle when recalling information, the better your memory of it is strengthened and it'll take you longer to forget it the next time. And it keeps going in a positive feedback loop: forget, struggle, remember, forget after a longer time, struggle, remember.

If you keep this going, it will eventually take you 40 years to forget something completely. This is the power of spaced repetition and active recall.

I don't have the time how to show you to use anki, but follow this video to learn how to use it:

Then just make basic and reversed flash cards with the front being Allah's name and the back being the meaning of the name. Then just practice the flashcards 5 minutes a day.

This app may cost $25 on the IPhone, but it's worth it. With the power of Anki, I was able to memorize all the 99 names and even become fluent in Spanish. It's the best investment you could ever make in your learning journey.

### Example

Let's go through an example of how I memorized the first 5 names.

- Ar-Rahmaan: The Most Gracious
- Ar-Rahim: The Most Merciful
- Al-Malik: The King
- Al-Quddus: The Most Holy
- As-Salam: The Peace Giver

#### Step 1: Add to Anki

I add all these flashcards to anki and then practice them.

#### Step 2: ChatGPT

I'll ask ChatGPT the meaning of each of these names.

This helps me to understand the name on a deeper level and therefore memorize it better.

Here is the link to my chat, but I suggest you make your own:

[ChatGPT Convo Allah's Names](https://chatgpt.com/share/6724dc53-a8e0-800c-be6f-6187c0a74cff)

#### Step 3: Mental image

The first name in this 5-name series is Ar-Rahmaan, so I'll create a mental image of the letter R to remember it. The main rule that worked for me is that the funnier or quirkier the image is, the better you'll remember it.

I imagined a giant letter R walking up and then doing the orange justice dance from Fortnite. Whenever I remember this, I'm like, "Oh, R dancing is Ar-Rahmaan."

The memory palace technique truly works wonders when you connect it to other mental images. For example, the first name in the next series of 5 names is Al-Mu'min. I used the image of the giant letter M walking in high heels and then falling down on its face.

:::tip
The technique may work even better if you conjure an image that represents the meaning of the actual word. For example, I imagined Ad-Darr (The Afflictor and bringer of hardship) as the giant letter D shaking the ground, creating an earthquake and killing a bunch of people.

Here is the exact memory palace script I used to memorize the 99 names: [My Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bn4s0BHxv-NjK8IOvcTcztizDah7OlEeg2McdZ9h_Rg/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Step 4: Active Recall Practice

I then rehearsed the 5 names for the day several times in a row until I got the order and names right 7 consecutive times. This is the most important part of the process. If you don't practice recalling the information, then you won't remember it.

Even if you practice Anki, you won't memorize the order - just the meanings.

### All together

If you practice the 4 steps I listed above everyday for 5-10 minutes, you'll easily remember all 99 names in a month. Whenever I walk from class to class, I silently recite the names in order, employing active recall.

Once you have memorized all 99 names (and using the techniques above it will be extremely easy), you should use the principles of spaced repetition to maintain the names in your memory. Just practice the names once a week and you'll never forget them.

Just keep consistent and keep it small. Do not speed run this. That's not how myelination and learning work.
