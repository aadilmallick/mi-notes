# Juz 20

## Surah Qasas

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

Moses accidentally killed a dude by punching him too hard and cried for forgiveness. From these verses we see that to kill another human being is to wrong one's own soul.

>˹One day˺ he entered the city unnoticed by its people.1 There he found two men fighting: one of his own people, and the other of his enemies. The man from his people called to him for help against his foe. So Moses punched him, causing his death. Moses cried, “This is from Satan’s handiwork. He is certainly a sworn, misleading enemy.” He pleaded, “My Lord! I have definitely wronged my soul, so forgive me.” So He forgave him, ˹for˺ He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (15-16)

**verses 50-70**

Allah describes the people who follow their desires over any other guidance as the most stray people.

>So if they fail to respond to you, then know that they only follow their desires. And who could be more astray than those who follow their desires with no guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. (50)


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Important lesson: respond to evil with good. No matter what, be the kinder person.


> These ˹believers˺ will be given a double reward for their perseverance, responding to evil with good, and for donating from what We have provided for them. When they hear slanderous talk, they turn away from it, saying, “We are accountable for our deeds and you for yours. Peace ˹is our only response˺ to you! We want nothing to do with those who act ignorantly.” (54-55)

>You surely cannot guide whoever you like ˹O Prophet˺, but it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills, and He knows best who are ˹fit to be˺ guided. (56)

Being spoiled by comfortable living destroys your soul.

>˹Imagine˺ how many societies We have destroyed that had been spoiled by their ˹comfortable˺ living! Those are their residences, never inhabited after them except passingly.1 And We ˹alone˺ were the Successor. (58)

>Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is no more than ˹a fleeting˺ enjoyment and adornment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more lasting. Will you not then understand? (60)

**verses 60-end**

> As for those who repent, believe, and do good ˹in this world˺, it is right to hope that they will be among the successful. (67)

>But those gifted with knowledge said, “Shame on you! Allah’s reward is far better for those who believe and do good. But none will attain this except the steadfast.” (80)

>That ˹eternal˺ Home in the Hereafter We reserve ˹only˺ for those who seek neither tyranny nor corruption on the earth. The ultimate outcome belongs ˹only˺ to the righteous. (83)
