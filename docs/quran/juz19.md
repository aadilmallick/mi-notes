# Juz 19

## Surah Shuara

### Summary

**verses 1-10**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah points out that he doesn't need to give any super compelling sign as that would defeat the purpose of testing people in their belief. There are already obvious signs in the beauty of nature and the universe, but people take those signs for granted.


>Perhaps you ˹O Prophet˺ will grieve yourself to death over their disbelief. If We willed, We could send down upon them a ˹compelling˺ sign from the heavens, leaving their necks bent in ˹utter˺ submission to it. (3-4)

We take some of the most obvious signs for granted.

>Have they failed to look at the earth, ˹to see˺ how many types of fine plants We have caused to grow in it? Surely in this is a sign. Yet most of them would not believe. (7-8)

**verses 10-90**

The same old magician moses story

>Then Moses threw down his staff, and—behold!—it devoured the objects of their illusion! So the magicians fell down, prostrating. They declared, “We ˹now˺ believe in the Lord of all worlds—the Lord of Moses and Aaron.”
>
>Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic, but soon you will see. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, then crucify you all.”
>
>They responded, “˹That would be˺ no harm! Surely to our Lord we will ˹all˺ return. We really hope that our Lord will forgive our sins, as we are the first to believe.” (45-51)

>˹He is˺ the One Who created me, and He ˹alone˺ guides me. ˹He is˺ the One Who provides me with food and drink. And He ˹alone˺ heals me when I am sick. And He ˹is the One Who˺ will cause me to die, and then bring me back to life. And He is ˹the One˺ Who, I hope, will forgive my flaws1 on Judgment Day.” (78-82)

You can only go to heaven if you have a pure heart before you die. You need to get rid of all the nastiness, envy, and malicious desires in your heart before you can become the true human being.

>Only those who come before Allah with a pure heart ˹will be saved˺. (89)

All the worldly enjoyment the disbelievers have will have been useless on the day of judgement. What benefit would that enjoyment have in the face of eternal suffering? One bad day of suffering can make you forget 60 years of enjoyment. Imagine if you had to face an eternity of it?

>Imagine ˹O Prophet˺ if We allowed them enjoyment for years, then there came to them what they had been threatened with: would that enjoyment be of any benefit to them ˹at all˺? (205-207)

>Put your trust in the Almighty, Most Merciful, Who sees you when you rise ˹for prayer at night˺, as well as your movements ˹in prayer˺ along with ˹fellow˺ worshippers. He ˹alone˺ is indeed the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. (217-220)

## Surah Naml

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

>Ṭâ-Sĩn. These are the verses of the Quran; the clear Book. ˹It is˺ a guide and good news for the believers: ˹those˺ who establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and have sure faith in the Hereafter. As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We have certainly made their ˹evil˺ deeds appealing to them, so they wander blindly. It is they who will suffer a dreadful torment, and in the Hereafter they will ˹truly˺ be the greatest losers. (1-5)

The only time you should have fear is fear of meeting your lord on the day of judgement and you have not done your due diligence in being righteous and pious.

>˹Fear is˺ only for those who do wrong. But if they later mend ˹their˺ evil ˹ways˺ with good, then I am certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (11)

>Surely your Lord is ever Bountiful to humanity,1 but most of them are ungrateful. (73)

>And surely your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal. For there is nothing hidden in the heavens or the earth without being ˹written˺ in a perfect Record. (74-75)

You can't guide anyone else to Allah. They have to come to him on their own.

>So put your trust in Allah, for you are surely upon the ˹Path of˺ clear truth. You certainly cannot make the dead hear ˹the truth˺. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk away. Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can make none hear ˹the truth˺ except those who believe in Our revelations, ˹fully˺ submitting ˹to Allah˺. (79-81)

**verses 80-100**

>And ˹beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown, and all those in the heavens and all those on the earth will be horrified ˹to the point of death˺,1 except those Allah wills ˹to spare˺. And all will come before Him, fully humbled. (87)

This verse refers to plate tectonics and how Allah has designed the Earth.

>Now you see the mountains, thinking they are firmly fixed, but they are travelling ˹just˺ like clouds. ˹That is˺ the design of Allah, Who has perfected everything. Surely He is All-Aware of what you do. (88)
