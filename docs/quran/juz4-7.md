# Juz 4-7

## Surah nisa

### Summary

**verses 1-10**


> [!NOTE] 
> Allah warns against consuming an orphan's wealth but who tf would do that anyway? He also warns against knowingly persisting in sin, as he will not forgive you for that.


>O humanity! Be mindful of your Lord Who created you from a single soul, and from it He created its mate,1 and through both He spread countless men and women. And be mindful of Allah—in Whose Name you appeal to one another—and ˹honour˺ family ties. Surely Allah is ever Watchful over you. (1)

>Let the guardians be as concerned ˹for the orphans˺ as they would if they were to ˹die and˺ leave ˹their own˺ helpless children behind. So let them be mindful of Allah and speak equitably. (9)

>Indeed, those who unjustly consume orphans’ wealth ˹in fact˺ consume nothing but fire into their bellies. And they will be burned in a blazing Hell! (10)

Allah only accepts the repentance of people who commit sins ignorantly or rashly and then immediately repent. There is no loophole to God's justice. You can't commit the worst crimes ever and then only repent at the end of your life when you are dying so you will go to heaven. If you knowingly persist in a sin, you will not be forgiven. 

> Allah only accepts the repentance of those who commit evil ignorantly ˹or recklessly˺ then repent soon after—Allah will pardon them. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. However, repentance is not accepted from those who knowingly persist in sin until they start dying, and then cry, “Now I repent!” nor those who die as disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment. (17-18)

**verses 20 -40**

>O believers! Do not devour one another’s wealth illegally, but rather trade by mutual consent. And do not kill ˹each other or˺ yourselves. Surely Allah is ever Merciful to you. (29)

>If you avoid the major sins forbidden to you, We will absolve you of your ˹lesser˺ misdeeds and admit you into a place of honour. (31)

Don't be envious of what other people have. None of that will matter on the day of judgement. Instead, just ask for the hereafter and goodness in this world. 

>And do not crave what Allah has given some of you over others. Men will be rewarded according to their deeds and women ˹equally˺ according to theirs. Rather, ask Allah for His bounties. Surely Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. (32)

Giving to charity just to show off your wealth is a despicable act because you are only doing it to further your own ego. 

>Likewise for those who spend their wealth to show off and do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. And whoever takes Satan as an associate—what an evil associate they have! (38)

**verses 40-70**

>Indeed, Allah never wrongs ˹anyone˺—even by an atom’s weight.1 And if it is a good deed, He will multiply it many times over and will give a great reward out of His grace. (40)

>Indeed, Allah does not forgive associating others with Him ˹in worship˺,1 but forgives anything else of whoever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah has indeed committed a grave sin. (48)

>And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger will be in the company of those blessed by Allah: the prophets, the people of truth, the martyrs, and the righteous—what honourable company! This is Allah’s favour, and Allah fully knows ˹who deserves it˺. (69-70)

**verses 70-80**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah points out the hypocrisy and cowardice of people who don't go to war, thinking that they avoided death, but if the muslims had won, they wish they would have went to battle so they could share in the spoils. These hypocrites secretly wished to destroy the trangressors in the past, yet when the commandment for fighting finally came down, they got cold feet and didn't want to fight, fearing murder more than they feared their lord.

>There will be some among you who will lag behind so that if you face a disaster, they will say, “Allah has blessed us for not being there among them.” But if you return with Allah’s bounties, they will say—as if there had been no bond between you—“We wish we had been there with them to share the great gain!” (72-73)

Do not fear death or martyrdom. The hereafter is for those who fight in Allah's cause.

>Have you ˹O Prophet˺ not seen those who had been told, “Do not fight! Rather, establish prayer and pay alms-tax.”? Then once the order came to fight, a group of them feared those ˹hostile˺ people as Allah should be feared—or even more. They said, “Our Lord! Why have You ordered us to fight? If only You had delayed ˹the order for˺ us for a little while!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “The enjoyment of this world is so little, whereas the Hereafter is far better for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. And none of you will be wronged ˹even by the width of˺ the thread of a date stone.

Both good things come from Allah. Bad things you did to yourself. Death is inescapable, so there is no point in trying to escape the inevitable. Dodging Jihad does not mean you can dodge death.

>Wherever you may be, death will overcome you—even if you were in fortified towers.” When something good befalls them, they say, “This is from Allah,” but when something evil befalls them, they say, “This is from you.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Both have been destined by Allah.” So what is the matter with these people? They can hardly comprehend anything! (78)

**verses 80-90**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah claims there is no doubt about two things:
> 
> 1. There are no inconsistencies in the Quran, and that is because it is from God.
> 2. The Day of Judgement will come to pass


>Do they not then reflect on the Quran? Had it been from anyone other than Allah, they would have certainly found in it many inconsistencies. (82)

>Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a share in the reward, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in the burden. And Allah is Watchful over all things. (85)

>And when you are greeted, respond with a better greeting or at least similarly. Surely Allah is a ˹vigilant˺ Reckoner of all things. (86)

>Allah, there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He will certainly gather ˹all of˺ you together on the Day of Judgment—about which there is no doubt. And whose word is more truthful than Allah’s? (87)

**verses 90 - 100**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah says that killing a believer unintentionally means you will have to give blood money, but killing a believer intentionally is crossing the line and makes you deserve hell. Allah also make emigration required whenever you are being oppressed.

>And whoever kills a believer intentionally, their reward will be Hell—where they will stay indefinitely.1 Allah will be displeased with them, condemn them, and will prepare for them a tremendous punishment. (93)

This verse refers to a man who killed a secret muslim who said ASAK just so he could steal the corpse's money.

>O believers! When you struggle in the cause of Allah, be sure of who you fight. And do not say to those who offer you ˹greetings of˺ peace, “You are no believer!”—seeking a fleeting worldly gain. (94)

The martyrs are above the normal believers who are scared of Jihad. 

>Those believers who stay at home—except those with valid excuses1—are not equal to those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has elevated in rank those who strive with their wealth and their lives above those who stay behind ˹with valid excuses˺. Allah has promised each a fine reward, but those who strive will receive a far better reward than others— far superior ranks, forgiveness, and mercy from Him. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (95-96)

If you are being oppressed, you are required to emigrate. Allah's world is spacious, and you will go to hell if you do not emigrate to avoid oppression. But of course, Allah is understanding of all circumstances and will pardon those who are unable to emigrate.

>When the angels seize the souls of those who have wronged themselves1—scolding them, “What was wrong with you?” they will reply, “We were oppressed in the land.” The angels will respond, “Was Allah’s earth not spacious enough for you to emigrate?” It is they who will have Hell as their home—what an evil destination! Except helpless men, women, and children who cannot afford a way out— it is right to hope that Allah will pardon them. For Allah is Ever-Pardoning, All-Forgiving. (97-99)

**verses 100 - 120**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah says that committing a sin is wronging your own soul.

Allah is understanding of your circumstances and knows that praying normally is not an option in dire circumstances. But he has still ordained prayer on you, where sitting or lying down.

>When the prayers are over, remember Allah—whether you are standing, sitting, or lying down. But when you are secure, establish regular prayers. Indeed, performing prayers is a duty on the believers at the appointed times. (103)

Don't advocate for sinners, because you surely wouldn't advocate for them on the day of judgement.

>Do not advocate for those who wrong themselves.1 Surely Allah does not like those who are deceitful, sinful. Here you are! You ˹believers˺ are advocating for them in this life, but who will ˹dare to˺ advocate for them before Allah on the Day of Judgment? Or who will come to their defence? (107-108)

Committing a sin is wronging yourself, so seek Allah's forgiveness.

>Whoever commits evil or wrongs themselves then seeks Allah’s forgiveness will certainly find Allah All-Forgiving, Most Merciful (110)

>And whoever commits a sin—it is only to their own loss. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. (111)

**verses 120 - 130**

>And those who believe and do good, We will soon admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah’s promise is ˹always˺ true. And whose word is more truthful than Allah’s? (122)

Allah is saying here that it doesn't matter which religion is superior - Islam, Judaism, Christianity - but rather what matters is doing good deeds and forgetting the superfluous unimportant nature of religion. Good deeds lie in the heart of religion. Practice what you preach instead of only preaching.

>˹Divine grace is˺ neither by your wishes nor those of the People of the Book! Whoever commits evil will be rewarded accordingly, and they will find no protector or helper besides Allah. But those who do good—whether male or female—and have faith will enter Paradise and will never be wronged ˹even as much as˺ the speck on a date stone. (123-124)

Allah says that humans are naturally selfish.

>Humans are ever inclined to selfishness. (128)

**verses 130-140**

Allah establishes here that humanity isn't really that important. He can destroy us and replace us with another race to accomplish his divine plan.

>If it is His Will, He can remove you altogether, O  humanity, and replace you with others. And Allah is Most Capable to do so. (133)

Allah highlights the important of justice, even if it's against your loved ones. Being righteous is more important than doing right by your family.

>O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor, Allah is best to ensure their interests. So do not let your desires cause you to deviate ˹from justice˺. If you distort the testimony or refuse to give it, then ˹know that˺ Allah is certainly All-Aware of what you do. (135)

Don't sit in the company of people that ridicule your religion. It will only make you stray far away.

>He has already revealed to you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s revelations being denied or ridiculed, then do not sit in that company unless they engage in a different topic, or else you will be like them.1 Surely Allah will gather the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell. (140)

**verses 140-150**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah warns against being apart of the hypocrites, which are those people who pretend to be good muslims on the surface, wanting people's praise and appreciation more than appearing good before God. A sincere person is one who acts for Allah alone and does not like that people praise him for it.

> Surely the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He outwits them. When they stand up for prayer, they do it half-heartedly only to be seen by people—hardly remembering Allah at all. Torn between belief and disbelief—belonging neither to these ˹believers˺ nor those ˹disbelievers˺. And whoever Allah leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way. (142-143)

>Why should Allah punish you if you are grateful and faithful? Allah is ever Appreciative, All-Knowing. (147)

**verses 150-175**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah talks about the death of Jesus and how we will return as the the Messiah on judgement day. He also warns about the trinity, saying that Jesus is not the son of God.

People won't ever stop asking for more and more ridiculous miracles. Miracles rarely change faith. 

>The People of the Book demand that you ˹O Prophet˺ bring down for them a revelation in writing from heaven.1 They demanded what is even greater than this from Moses, saying, “Make Allah visible to us!” So a thunderbolt struck them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear signs. Still We forgave them for that ˹after their repentance˺ and gave Moses compelling proof. (153)

>O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes regarding your faith; say nothing about Allah except the truth.1 The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of Allah and the fulfilment of His Word through Mary and a spirit ˹created by a command˺ from Him.2 So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say, “Trinity.” Stop!—for your own good. Allah is only One God. Glory be to Him! He is far above having a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is sufficient as a Trustee of Affairs. (171)

>O humanity! There has come to you conclusive evidence from your Lord. And We have sent down to you a brilliant light. (174)
### The story of the spider

A prophecy foretold that a newborn girl would grow up to sleep with a hundred men and die by a spider. Despite attempts to alter her fate, the prophecy came true. The beautiful girl survived an attempt on her life as a baby, later fulfilled the first part of the prophecy, and ultimately died from a spider bite, even though she lived in a clean, spider-free palace.

An an antithesis to the girl, the "Sword of Allah," Khalid ibn Walid spent his life in battle while longing to die as a martyr. Despite his bravery and participation in numerous battles, he ultimately died peacefully in bed, demonstrating that death occurs as Allah wills, not necessarily as one desires or anticipates.

Death is inevitable and determined solely by Allah. Human efforts cannot change its timing or circumstances. Whether one is in the midst of danger or in the safety of a palace, death will occur as decreed by Allah, underscoring the importance of trusting in His divine will.

## Surah Ma'idah

### Summary

**verses 1-10**


> [!NOTE]
> **Summary**:  Allah says that the forbidden foods are haram:
> - Anything slaughtered in the name other than Allah
> - Anything gored to death


>Today I have perfected your faith for you, completed My favour upon you, and chosen Islam as your way. (3)

Allah's exigence of ablution is not a burden but rather a way to purify yourself before prayer. You can't be holy in prayer when you have crusty semen or piss on your pants. 

>O believers! When you rise up for prayer, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, wipe your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of ˹full˺ impurity,1 then take a full bath. But if you are ill, on a journey, or have relieved yourselves, or have been intimate with your wives and cannot find water, then purify yourselves with clean earth by wiping your faces and hands.2 It is not Allah’s Will to burden you, but to purify you and complete His favour upon you, so perhaps you will be grateful. (6)

Even if you hate an enemy, be fair with them and act according to the laws of justice. Do not let emotion impede on righteousness and justice.

>O believers! Stand firm for Allah and bear true testimony. Do not let the hatred of a people lead you to injustice. Be just! That is closer to righteousness. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what you do. (8)

You are not special to Allah. We are just humans and are being tested by God. 

>The Jews and the Christians each say, “We are the children of Allah and His most beloved!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Why then does He punish you for your sins? No! You are only humans like others of His Own making. He forgives whoever He wills and punishes whoever He wills. To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. And to Him is the final return.” (18)

**verses 20 - 40**

> [!NOTE]
> **Summary**:  Allah relates the story of Cain and Abel to highlight just how evil murder is, and that killing somebody unjustly is as if one has killed all of humanity. 

This verse said by Abel before he was killed by Cain shows how wrong it is to kill somebody. He would rather die than kill another person out of fear to Allah. 

>If you raise your hand to kill me, I will not raise mine to kill you, because I fear Allah—the Lord of all worlds. (28)

>Still, the other convinced himself to kill his own brother, so he killed him—becoming a loser. Then Allah sent a crow digging ˹a grave˺ in the ground ˹for a dead crow˺, in order to show him how to bury the corpse of his brother. He cried, “Alas! Have I ˹even˺ failed to be like this crow and bury the corpse of my brother?” So he became regretful.1 (30-31)

Damn what a fucking banger of quote

>That is why We ordained for the Children of Israel that whoever takes a life—unless as a punishment for murder or mischief in the land—it will be as if they killed all of humanity; and whoever saves a life, it will be as if they saved all of humanity. (32)

**verses 40-80**

> [!NOTE]
> **Summary**:  Allah says that the Quran is a confirmation of the previous scriptures: the Torah and Gospel. He also chastises the Trinitarians for believing that Jesus is God, when he was a human just like them. 

>O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever Allah allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against Allah. It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter. (41)

>Indeed, the believers, Jews, Sabians1 and Christians—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve (69)

>Those who say, “Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. The Messiah ˹himself˺ said, “O Children of Israel! Worship Allah—my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever associates others with Allah ˹in worship˺ will surely be forbidden Paradise by Allah. Their home will be the Fire. And the wrongdoers will have no helpers. (72)

>Those who say, “Allah is one in a Trinity,” have certainly fallen into disbelief. There is only One God. If they do not stop saying this, those who disbelieve among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment. (73)

Jesus ate food like every other human being. It would be foolish to believe he is God. 

>The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. ˹Many˺ messengers had ˹come and˺ gone before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both ate food.1 See how We make the signs clear to them, yet see how they are deluded ˹from the truth˺! (75)

**verses 80-100**

> [!NOTE]
> **Summary**:  Drawing lots for decisions and making heedless oaths are both sins. 

>Allah will not call you to account for your thoughtless oaths, but He will hold you accountable for deliberate oaths. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten poor people from what you normally feed your own family, or to clothe them, or to free a bondsperson. But if none of this is affordable, then you must fast three days. This is the penalty for breaking your oaths. So be mindful of your oaths. This is how Allah makes things clear to you, so perhaps you will be grateful. (89)

This is why alcohol and gambling are bad:

>Satan’s plan is to stir up hostility and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from remembering Allah and praying. Will you not then abstain? (91)

**verses 100 to 110**

> [!NOTE]
> **Summary**: Stay on the path of good no matter how common and normal evil is made out to be. Also do not excessively question religion and practices. Focus on the heart of God instead. One of the qualities making someone a good Muslim is that one leaves what is unnecessary. There is no need for a ruling on what happens if you eat a pig in Minecraft you stupid fuck. 

The verse below is saying that although there may be such wide prevalence of evil, don't take it to be something harmless or even good just because everybody else is doing it. 

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Good and evil are not equal, though you may be dazzled by the abundance of evil. So be mindful of Allah, O  people of reason, so you may be successful.” (100)

The verse below talks about some people question divine providence so much and unnecessarily that they lose out on the point of religion. 

Do not ask questions by digging and prying into them. Communities before you have been damned eternally through this very proliferation of questioning because they, questions after questions about what Allah and His Messenger did not make obligatory on them, and in consequence of their unnecessary enquiry, these optional things were made obligatory - and then, they got involved in the unfortunate practice of disobeying these. Your estab-lished routine should be: Do what I order you to do, with the best of your ability, and leave what I order you not to do (that is, do not dig and pry into things about which no injunctions are given).

 It is also a part of Islamic teachings that one should not indulge in any activity, whether intellectual or practical, a task or a conversation, and waste precious time through it, unless there is some gain to be made from it in terms of the worldly or other-wordly life.

>O believers! Do not ask about any matter which, if made clear to you, may disturb you. But if you inquire about what is being revealed in the Quran, it will be made clear to you. Allah has forgiven what was done ˹in the past˺. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. (101)

The verse below shows the ridiculousness of following the exact same practices your ancestors have done since your ancestors were probably dumb as hell and don't have any guidance. 

>When it is said to them, “Come to Allah’s revelations and to the Messenger,” they reply, “What we found our forefathers practicing is good enough for us.” ˹Would they still do so,˺ even if their forefathers had absolutely no knowledge or guidance? (104)

>O believers! You are accountable only for yourselves.1 It will not harm you if someone chooses to deviate—as long as you are ˹rightly˺ guided. To Allah you will all return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. (105)

**verses 110-120**

> [!NOTE]
> **Summary**: In these verses Allah talks about how we blessed Jesus with the miracle of the last supper where a feast came down from the sky. Allah will ask Jesus on Judgement Day if he told his followers to think of Jesus as God, and Jesus will deny those allegations. 

>And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My favour upon you and your mother: how I supported you with the holy spirit1 so you spoke to people in ˹your˺ infancy and adulthood. How I taught you writing, wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel. How you moulded a bird from clay—by My Will—and breathed into it and it became a ˹real˺ bird—by My Will. How you healed the blind and the lepers—by My Will. How you brought the dead to life—by My Will. How I prevented the Children of Israel from harming you when you came to them with clear proofs and the disbelievers among them said, “This is nothing but pure magic.” (111)

>Jesus, son of Mary, prayed, “O Allah, our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread with food as a feast for us—the first and last of us—and as a sign from You. Provide for us! You are indeed the Best Provider.” Allah answered, “I am sending it down to you. But whoever among you denies afterwards will be subjected to a torment I have never inflicted on anyone of My creation.” (114-115)

>And ˹on Judgment Day˺ Allah will say, “O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever ask the people to worship you and your mother as gods besides Allah?” He will answer, “Glory be to You! How could I ever say what I had no right to say? If I had said such a thing, you would have certainly known it. You know what is ˹hidden˺ within me, but I do not know what is within You. Indeed, You ˹alone˺ are the Knower of all unseen. (116)

## Surah Anam

### Summary

**verses 1-10**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: The core theme of these verses is that obvious evidence defeats the purpose of creating humanity in the first place, as the test is to see who will or will not believe. Even if the evidence was obvious, some people would choose to disbelieve out of arrogance and ignorance anyway. God doesn't need people to believe in him. He tests their belief.  There is no free will, no autonomy if everybody knows God exists. 


>All praise is for Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light (1)

Even if the most obvious evidence was shown to people, they would stay ignorant and disbelieve. This is why miracles are not sufficient to make people believe. 

>Had We sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺ a revelation in writing and they were to touch it with their own hands, the disbelievers would still have said, “This is nothing but pure magic!” (7)

>They say, “Why has no ˹visible˺ angel come with him?” Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been settled ˹at once˺,1 and they would have never been given more time ˹to repent˺. (8)

**verses 10-30**

>If Allah touches you with harm, none can undo it except Him. And if He touches you with a blessing, He is Most Capable of everything (17)

Some people even when they listen to the Quran, they cast it out as fables. 

>There are some of them who ˹pretend to˺ listen to your recitation ˹of the Quran˺, but We have cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend it—and deafness in their ears. Even if they were to see every sign, they still would not believe in them. The disbelievers would ˹even˺ come to argue with you, saying, “This ˹Quran˺ is nothing but ancient fables!” (25)

>They turn others away from the Prophet and distance themselves as well. They ruin none but themselves, yet they fail to perceive it. (26)

Some people are so arrogant in their disbelief that even if they were to be sent back with the knowledge that God existed, they would still end up among the disbelievers and break God's laws and covenants. 

>If only you could see when they will be detained before the Fire! They will cry, “Oh! If only we could be sent back, we would never deny the signs of our Lord and we would ˹surely˺ be of the believers.” But no! ˹They only say this˺ because the truth they used to hide will become all too clear to them. Even if they were to be sent back, they would certainly revert to what they were forbidden. Indeed they are liars! (27-28)

**verses 30-40**

> **Summary**: Allah is urging to us to forget this worldly life, which is nothing more than a delusion, and instead to focus on judgement day where each soul will be rewarded or punished according to what they have done in their life. 

>Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with Allah until the Hour takes them by surprise, then they will cry, “Woe to us for having ignored this!” They will bear ˹the burden of˺ their sins on their backs. Evil indeed is their burden! (31)

>This worldly life is no more than play and amusement, but far better is the ˹eternal˺ Home of the Hereafter for those mindful ˹of Allah˺. Will you not then understand? (32)

Allah has chosen to not make his signs obvious because belief is a test. If Allah had willed, he could have made everybody a single religion and people. 

> If you find their denial unbearable, then build—if you can—a tunnel through the earth or stairs to the sky to bring them a ˹more compelling˺ sign. Had Allah so willed, He could have guided them all. So do not be one of those ignorant ˹of this fact˺. (35)

>They ask, “Why has no ˹other˺ sign been sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah certainly has the power to send down a sign”—though most of them do not know. (37)

>Those who deny Our signs are ˹wilfully˺ deaf and dumb—lost in darkness. Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills to the Straight Way. (39)

If the terror of the day of judgement arrives, wouldn't you exclaim repeatedly, "oh, God!" Then why did you disbelieve in your previous life?

>Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Imagine if you were overwhelmed by Allah’s torment or the Hour—would you call upon any other than Allah ˹for help˺? ˹Answer me˺ if your claims are true! (40)

Allah talks about how people don't humble themselves when disaster strikes, and they equally don't humble themselves when fortune strikes. 

>Why did they not humble themselves when We made them suffer? Instead, their hearts were hardened, and Satan made their misdeeds appealing to them. When they became oblivious to warnings, We showered them with everything they desired. But just as they became prideful of what they were given, We seized them by surprise, then they instantly fell into despair! (43-44)

> We have sent messengers only as deliverers of good news and as warners. Whoever believes and does good, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. (48)

**verses 50 to 70**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah establishes himself as a witness over all things. He knows everything and anything. 

>With Him are the keys of the unseen—no one knows them except Him.1 And He knows what is in the land and sea. Not even a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth or anything—green or dry—but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record (59)

>He is the One Who calls back your souls by night and knows what you do by day, then revives you daily to complete your appointed term. To Him is your ˹ultimate˺ return, then He will inform you of what you used to do. (60)

Allah says here that he is the distressor, that he can split people into factions and make them fight one another. 

>Say, “He ˹alone˺ has the power to unleash upon you a torment from above or below you or split you into ˹conflicting˺ factions and make you taste the violence of one another.” See how We vary the signs, so perhaps they will comprehend. (65)

>Every ˹destined˺ matter has a ˹set˺ time to transpire. And you will soon come to know. (67)

>Those mindful ˹of Allah˺ will not be accountable for those ˹who ridicule it˺ whatsoever—their duty is to advise, so perhaps the ridiculers will abstain. (69)

There are muslims who are just muslims for show, but have no real faith nor practice. They are extremely worldly. Don't be one of those people.

>And leave those who take this1 faith ˹of Islam˺ as mere play and amusement and are deluded by ˹their˺ worldly life. Yet remind them by this ˹Quran˺, so no one should be ruined for their misdeeds. (70)

**verses 70-100**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah relates to us the story of Abraham. In his search for a God to believe in, he first believed in the moon - but then it went away. Then he believed in the sun - shit, it also went away. 

This universe is a testament to the beauty of God's creation and should be an infuser of faith. 

>We also showed Abraham the wonders of the heavens and the earth, so he would be sure in faith. (75)

Even if you do good deeds, they are wasted if you are a polytheist. 

>This is Allah’s guidance with which He guides whoever He wills of His servants. Had they associated others with Him ˹in worship˺, their ˹good˺ deeds would have been wasted. (88)

>Indeed, Allah is the One Who causes seeds and fruit stones to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. That is Allah! How can you then be deluded ˹from the truth˺? (95)

>And He is the One Who has made the stars as your guide through the darkness of land and sea. We have already made the signs clear for people who know. (97)

**verses 100 - 120**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: If something is not slaughtered in Allah's name, then it is haram. 

>˹He is˺ the Originator of the heavens and earth. How could He have children when He has no mate? He created all things and has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of everything. (101)

He sees everything but nothing can see him. 

>No vision can encompass Him, but He encompasses all vision. For He is the Most Subtle, All-Aware. (103)

>Indeed, there have come to you insights from your Lord. So whoever chooses to see, it is for their own good. But whoever chooses to be blind, it is to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you. (104)

Again, Allah conveys to us that he could have made everybody muslims, but he doesn't to test us. 

>Had Allah willed, they would not have been polytheists. We have not appointed you as their keeper, nor are you their maintainer. (107)

No need to attack the disbeliever's ignorant beliefs. To do so is to bring unnecessary shame on the religion and involve yourself in petty affairs. Instead trust they will be recompensed accordingly on the day of judgement. 

>˹O believers!˺ Do not insult what they invoke besides Allah or they will insult Allah spitefully out of ignorance. This is how We have made each people’s deeds appealing to them. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they used to do. (108)

Allah says that even if you showed them the most obvious signs, the disbelievers would still disbelieve. They are willfully blind. 

>They swear by Allah their most solemn oaths that if a sign were to come to them, they would certainly believe in it. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Signs are only with Allah.” What will make you ˹believers˺ realize that even if a sign were to come to them, they still would not believe? We turn their hearts and eyes away ˹from the truth˺ as they refused to believe at first, leaving them to wander blindly in their defiance. Even if We had sent them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and assembled before their own eyes every sign ˹they demanded˺, they still would not have believed—unless Allah so willed. But most of them are ignorant ˹of this˺. (109-111)


Most people are not on the straight path. Do not follow the common path. 

>˹O Prophet!˺ If you were to obey most of those on earth, they would lead you away from Allah’s Way. They follow nothing but assumptions and do nothing but lie. (116)

**verses 120 -150**

>Whoever Allah wills to guide, He opens their heart to Islam.1 But whoever He wills to leave astray, He makes their chest tight and constricted as if they were climbing up into the sky. This is how Allah dooms those who disbelieve. (125)

The only things that are haram are pig, blood, or an offering slaughtered in the name of anything other than Allah.

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to eat except carrion, running blood, swine—which is impure—or a sinful offering in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—then surely your Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” (145)

Allah is the most merciful, so the truly wicked people truly deserve their punishment.

>“Your Lord is infinite in mercy, yet His punishment will not be averted from the wicked people.” (147)

It was not in Allah's will to make everybody believers. That defeats the purpose of free will. 

>Say, “Allah has the most conclusive argument. Had it been His Will, He would have easily imposed guidance upon all of you.” (149)

**verses 150-end**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah relays simple laws of the 10 commandments and illustrates how simple religion truly is. Yet people will make sects out of a false sense of superiority.

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Come! Let me recite to you what your Lord has forbidden to you: do not associate others with Him ˹in worship˺. ˹Do not fail to˺ honour your parents. Do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for you and for them. Do not come near indecencies, openly or secretly. Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right.1 This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will understand. And do not come near the wealth of the orphan—unless intending to enhance it—until they attain maturity. Give full measure and weigh with justice. We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. Whenever you speak,1 maintain justice—even regarding a close relative. And fulfil your covenant with Allah. This is what He has commanded you, so perhaps you will be mindful. (151-152)

On the day of judgement, those who disbelieved in their previous life or believers who did not do any good or help society in their previous life will be losers on the day of judgement.

>Are they awaiting the coming of the angels, or your Lord ˹Himself˺, or some of your Lord’s ˹major˺ signs? On the Day your Lord’s signs arrive, belief will not benefit those who did not believe earlier or those who did no good through their faith.1 Say, “Keep waiting! We too are waiting.” (158)

>Indeed, you ˹O Prophet˺ are not responsible whatsoever for those who have divided their faith and split into sects. Their judgment rests only with Allah. And He will inform them of what they used to do. (159)

>Whoever comes with a good deed will be rewarded tenfold. But whoever comes with a bad deed will be punished for only one. None will be wronged. (160)

>Say, “Surely my prayer, my sacrifice, my life, and my death are all for Allah—Lord of all worlds. (162)
