# Juz26

## Surah Ahqaf

### Summary

> We only created the heavens and the earth and everything in between for a purpose and an appointed term. Yet the disbelievers are turning away from what they have been warned about. (3)

The steadfast believers need not fear the day of judgement.

>Surely those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast—there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. It is they who will be the residents of Paradise, staying there forever, as a reward for what they used to do. (13-14)

Allah has commanded you to honor their parents and especially mom since your mom raised you in hardship and weaned you for 30 months.

>We have commanded people to honour their parents. Their mothers bore them in hardship and delivered them in hardship. Their ˹period of˺ bearing and weaning is thirty months. In time, when the child reaches their prime at the age of forty, they pray, “My Lord! Inspire me to ˹always˺ be thankful for Your favours which You blessed me and my parents with, and to do good deeds that please You. And instil righteousness in my offspring. I truly repent to You, and I truly submit ˹to Your Will˺.” It is from these ˹people˺ that We will accept the good they did, and overlook their misdeeds—along with the residents of Paradise, ˹in fulfilment of˺ the true promise they have been given. (15-16)

>But some scold their parents, “Enough with you! Are you warning me that I will be brought forth ˹from the grave˺, while many generations had already perished before me ˹for good˺?” The parents cry to Allah for help, ˹and warn their child,˺ “Pity you. Have faith! Surely Allah’s promise is true.” But the deniers insist, “This is nothing but ancient fables.” (17)

Don't exhaust your pleasures right out the gate on the worldly life, because then you won't be allowed any pleasure in the hereafter. The Truth appears before a man, but, unwilling to relinquish worldly goals and material gain, he rejects it. This means that he sets worldly interests above the exigencies of the Hereafter; he wants to pursue the attractions of this world rather than seek the good things of the afterlife.

>˹Watch for˺ the Day ˹when˺ the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. ˹They will be told,˺ “You ˹already˺ exhausted your ˹share of˺ pleasures during your worldly life, and ˹fully˺ enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no right, and for your rebelliousness.” (20)

Your 5 senses are only a benefit to you if they help you accept faith in God's command. Otherwise, they're useless.

>And We gave them hearing, sight, and intellect. But neither their hearing, sight, nor intellect were of any benefit to them whatsoever, since they persisted in denying Allah’s signs. (26)

>Do they not realize that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and did not tire in creating them,1 is able to give life to the dead? Yes ˹indeed˺! He is certainly Most Capable of everything. (33)

## Surah Muhammad

### Summary

Allah could easily kill the disbelievers, but he lets us meet them in battle in order to test us in deeds.

>So when you meet the disbelievers ˹in battle˺, strike ˹their˺ necks until you have thoroughly subdued them, then bind them firmly. Later ˹free them either as˺ an act of grace or by ransom until the war comes to an end. So will it be. Had Allah willed, He ˹Himself˺ could have inflicted punishment on them. But He does ˹this only to˺ test some of you by means of others. And those who are martyred in the cause of Allah,1 He will never render their deeds void. (4)

>Can those ˹believers˺ who stand on clear proof from their Lord be like those whose evil deeds are made appealing to them and ˹only˺ follow their desires? (14)

The hypocrites are the ones who pick and choose from the Quran

>Indeed, those who relapse ˹into disbelief˺ after ˹true˺ guidance has become clear to them, ˹it is˺ Satan ˹that˺ has tempted them, luring them with false hopes.  That is because they said ˹privately˺ to those who ˹also˺ detest what Allah has revealed, “We will obey you in some matters.”1 But Allah ˹fully˺ knows what they are hiding. (25-26)

Allah knows what the hypocrites are thinking.

> Or do those with sickness in their hearts think that Allah will not ˹be able to˺ expose their malice? (29)

Believers are certain to be tested to see who will be steadfast in their faith and truly struggle in Allah's cause. 

> We will certainly test you ˹believers˺ until We prove those of you who ˹truly˺ struggle ˹in Allah’s cause˺ and remain steadfast, and reveal how you conduct yourselves. (31)

This worldly life is meaningless. What is truly important is the hereafter. Allah asks you to donate only a little of your wealth instead of everything, because by then you would resent Allah. Don't withhold from the generosity of Allah allowing you to keep the majority of your money.

> This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But if you are faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, He will grant you your ˹full˺ reward, and will not ask you ˹to donate all˺ your wealth. If He were to do so and pressure you, you would withhold and He would bring out your resentment. Here you are, being invited to donate ˹a little˺ in the cause of Allah. Still some of you withhold. And whoever does so, it is only to their own loss. For Allah is the Self-Sufficient, whereas you stand in need ˹of Him˺. If you ˹still˺ turn away, He will replace you with another people. And they will not be like you. (36-38)

## Surah Fath

### Summary

>Surely those who pledge allegiance to you ˹O Prophet˺ are actually pledging allegiance to Allah. Allah’s Hand is over theirs. Whoever breaks their pledge, it will only be to their own loss. And whoever fulfils their pledge to Allah, He will grant them a great reward. (10)

>The nomadic Arabs, who stayed behind, will say to you ˹O Prophet˺, “We were preoccupied with our wealth and families, so ask for forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, “Who then can stand between you and Allah in any way, if He intends harm or benefit for you? In fact, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. The truth is: you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families again. And that was made appealing in your hearts. You harboured evil thoughts ˹about Allah˺, and ˹so˺ became a doomed people.” (11-12)

>And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, then We surely have prepared for the disbelievers a blazing Fire. (13)

The true believers are the ones who have a light on their face, their face bright with piousness when prostrating to their lord.

>Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those with him are firm with the disbelievers1 and compassionate with one another. You see them bowing and prostrating2 ˹in prayer˺, seeking Allah’s bounty and pleasure. The sign ˹of brightness can be seen˺ on their faces from the trace of prostrating ˹in prayer˺. This is their description in the Torah.3 And their parable in the Gospel is that of a seed that sprouts its ˹tiny˺ branches, making it strong. Then it becomes thick, standing firmly on its stem, to the delight of the planters4—in this way Allah makes the believers a source of dismay for the disbelievers.5 To those of them who believe and do good, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward. (29)
## Surah Hujurat

Always vet information. Never believe in anything blindly.

>O believers, if an evildoer brings you any news, verify ˹it˺ so you do not harm people unknowingly, becoming regretful for what you have done (6)

>The believers are but one brotherhood, so make peace between your brothers. And be mindful of Allah so you may be shown mercy. (10)

To backbite and ridicule others is the opposite of being pious. It's hypocritical and evil to be mean to other people while saying you have faith, because that goes against faith.

>O believers! Do not let some ˹men˺ ridicule others, they may be better than them, nor let ˹some˺ women ridicule other women, they may be better than them. Do not defame one another, nor call each other by offensive nicknames. How evil it is to act rebelliously after having faith! And whoever does not repent, it is they who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. (11)

According to God, backbiting is as if you're literally eating the back flesh of another person, so don't do it.

>O  believers! Avoid many suspicions, ˹for˺ indeed, some suspicions are sinful. And do not spy, nor backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of their dead brother? You would despise that!1 And fear Allah. Surely Allah is ˹the˺ Accepter of Repentance, Most Merciful. (12)

The most noble of people are the righteous people.

>O humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺ know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware (13)

Following Islam is good for your own soul, and disbelieving wrongs your soul. 

>They regard their acceptance of Islam as a favour to you. Tell ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Do not regard your Islam as a favour to me. Rather, it is Allah Who has done you a favour by guiding you to the faith, if ˹indeed˺ you are faithful. (17)

## Surah Qaf

### Summary

>Have they not then looked at the sky above them: how We built it and adorned it ˹with stars˺, leaving it flawless? (6)

Allah knows everything: your inner thoughts, your actions, your desires. He knows you better than you know yourself. He has two angels recording your good deeds and the bad deeds.

>Indeed, ˹it is˺ We ˹Who˺ created humankind and ˹fully˺ know what their souls whisper to them, and We are closer to them than ˹their˺ jugular vein. (16)

>As the two recording-angels—˹one˺ sitting to the right, and ˹the other to˺ the left—note ˹everything˺, not a word does a person utter without having a ˹vigilant˺ observer ready ˹to write it down˺ (17-18)

Allah will not change his mind on the day of judgement. He already warned you and gave you enough time to believe and change your ways.

>Allah will respond, “Do not dispute in My presence, since I had already given you a warning. My Word cannot be changed,1 nor am I unjust to ˹My˺ creation.” (28-29)

>˹Beware of˺ the Day We will ask Hell, “Are you full ˹yet˺?” And it will respond, “Are there any more?” (30)

Those who are in awe of Allah without having ever seen him will have heaven.

>And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, not far off. ˹And it will be said to them,˺ “This is what you were promised, for whoever ˹constantly˺ turned ˹to Allah˺ and kept up ˹His commandments˺—who were in awe of the Most Compassionate without seeing ˹Him˺,1 and have come with a heart turning ˹only to Him˺. Enter it in peace. This is the Day of eternal life!” There they will have whatever they desire, and with Us is ˹even˺ more.1 (31-35)

>It is certainly We Who give life and cause death. And to Us is the final return. (43)
