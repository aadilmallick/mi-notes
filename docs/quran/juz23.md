# Juz 23

## Surah Yasin

### Summary

No matter if you gave the disbelievers a second chance, they would never believe. Thus hellfire is justified in their case.

>The decree ˹of torment˺ has already been justified against most of them, for they will never believe. (7)

>It is the same whether you warn them or not—they will never believe. (10)

>There is a sign for them in the dead earth: We give it life, producing grain from it for them to eat. And We have placed in it gardens of palm trees and grapevines, and caused springs to gush forth in it, so that they may eat from its fruit, which they had no hand in making. Will they not then give thanks? (33-35)

**verses 40-60**

People get snarky and think God will provide everybody with food and use it as an excuse to not donate to others. God doesn't provide for these people for a reason: he is testing us to see if we will provide.

> And when it is said to them, “Donate from what Allah has provided for you,” the disbelievers say to the believers, “Why should we feed those whom Allah could have fed if He wanted to? You are clearly astray!” (47)

>On that Day no soul will be wronged in the least, nor will you be rewarded except for what you used to do. (54)

>Had We willed, We could have easily blinded their eyes, so they would struggle to find their way. How then could they see? (66)

Allah gives us a sign in old age: we get older and wiser, but after a point we regress into dementia and forget everything.

>And whoever We grant a long life, We reverse them in development.1 Will they not then understand? (68)

>Do people not see that We have created them from a sperm-drop, then—behold!—they openly challenge ˹Us˺? (76)

## Surah Salfat

### Summary

Telling the story of Yunus

>Then the whale engulfed him while he was blameworthy. Had he not ˹constantly˺ glorified ˹Allah˺, he would have certainly remained in its belly until the Day of Resurrection. (142-144)

## Surah Sad

### Summary

**verses 1-30**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah recounts the story of the two shepherds coming to seek David's counsel. It was a test from Allah to see if David would judge fairly.

>Has the story of the two plaintiffs, who scaled the ˹wall of David’s˺ sanctuary, reached you ˹O Prophet˺? When they came into David’s presence, he was startled by them. They said, “Have no fear. ˹We are merely˺ two in a dispute: one of us has wronged the other. So judge between us with truth—do not go beyond ˹it˺—and guide us to the right way. This is my brother.1 He has ninety-nine sheep while I have ˹only˺ one. ˹Still˺ he asked me to give it up to him, overwhelming me with ˹his˺ argument.” David ˹eventually˺ ruled, “He has definitely wronged you in demanding ˹to add˺ your sheep to his. And certainly many partners wrong each other, except those who believe and do good—but how few are they!” Then David realized that We had tested him so he asked for his Lord’s forgiveness, fell down in prostration, and turned ˹to Him in repentance˺. So We forgave that for him. And he will indeed have ˹a status of˺ closeness to Us and an honourable destination! ˹We instructed him:˺ “O David! We have surely made you an authority in the land, so judge between people with truth. And do not follow ˹your˺ desires or they will lead you astray from Allah’s Way. Surely those who go astray from Allah’s Way will suffer a severe punishment for neglecting the Day of Reckoning.” (21-26)

Allah constantly assures us that he has created the universe for a purpose.

> We have not created the heavens and earth and everything in between without purpose—as the disbelievers think. So woe to the disbelievers because of the Fire! (27)

**verses 30-50**

>The tyrants will ask ˹one another˺, “But why do we not see those we considered to be lowly? Were we wrong in mocking them ˹in the world˺?1 Or do our eyes ˹just˺ fail to see them ˹in the Fire˺?” (62-63)

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I do not ask you for any reward for this ˹Quran˺, nor do I pretend to be someone I am not. It is only a reminder to the whole world. And you will certainly know its truth before long.” (86-88)
