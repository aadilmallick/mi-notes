# Juz 30

## Surah Naba

>the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, the Most Compassionate. No one will dare speak to Him on the Day the ˹holy˺ spirit1 and the angels will stand in ranks. None will talk, except those granted permission by the Most Compassionate and whose words are true. (37-38)

> Indeed, We have warned you of an imminent punishment—the Day every person will see ˹the consequences of˺ what their hands have done, and the disbelievers will cry, “I wish I were dust.”1 (40)

## Surah Naziat

Man is between two domains. One is the present world, which is before him, and the second is the world of the Hereafter, which is hidden from view. The real test of man is that he should prefer the Hereafter to the present world. But this can be done only by one who has the courage to exercise control over the base desires of the self and not behave arrogantly. Those who prefer the fleeting life are going to hell btw.

>then as for those who transgressed and preferred the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world, the Hellfire will certainly be ˹their˺ home. (37-39)

> And as for those who were in awe of standing before their Lord and restrained themselves from ˹evil˺ desires, Paradise will certainly be ˹their˺ home. (40-41)

>On the Day they see it, it will be as if they had stayed ˹in the world˺ no more than one evening or its morning. (46)

## Surah Abasa

>Then, when the Deafening Blast1 comes to pass—on that Day every person will flee from their own siblings, and ˹even˺ their mother and father, and ˹even˺ their spouse and children. For then everyone will have enough concern of their own. (33-37)

## Surah takwir

>Surely this ˹Quran˺ is only a reminder to the whole world—to whoever of you wills to take the Straight Way. But you cannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of all worlds. (27-29)


## Surah infitar

>O humanity! What has emboldened you against your Lord, the Most Generous, Who created you, fashioned you, and perfected your design moulding you in whatever form He willed? (6-8)

>Again, what will make you realize what Judgment Day is? ˹It is˺ the Day no soul will be of ˹any˺ benefit to another whatsoever, for all authority on that Day belongs to Allah ˹entirely˺. (18-19)

## Surah mutaffifin


>But on that Day the believers will be laughing at the disbelievers, as they sit on ˹canopied˺ couches, looking on. ˹The believers will be asked,˺ “Have the disbelievers ˹not˺ been paid back for what they used to do?” (34-36)

## Surah inshiqaq

>So what is the matter with them that they do not believe, and when the Quran is recited to them, they do not bow down ˹in submission˺?  (20-21)

## Surah buruj

The Story of the People of Trench

Verse 4 refers to the People of the Trench. Their story is recounted in a Hadith reported by Imam Muslim as follows: There was an infidel king who lived in bygone times. He had a soothsayer, or, according to some narrations, a magician. The infidel king is identified as the ruler of Yemen. His name, according to Ibn ` Abbas ؓ ، was Yusuf Dhu Nuwas, and he lived about seventy years before the birth of the Holy Prophet ﷺ . The soothsayer or magician [ occult teacher ] said to the king that he should be given an intelligent boy, so that he could train him in the skill of foretelling or the black magic. Accordingly, the king sent a boy, ` Abdullh Ibn Tamir by name, to be trained by the soothsayer or magician [ occult teacher ]. Whenever the boy went to his teacher, he had to pass by a Christian monk. He followed the true religion of ` Isa علیہ السلام and worshipped Allah. Since the religion of ` Ish (علیہ السلام) was the true religion in those days, the monk was, in fact, a Muslim. The boy sat with the monk and was very much impressed by his teachings. As a result, he frequented the monk's house and sat with him for long hours before proceeding to his teacher, and ultimately embraced Islam. Allah had blessed him with such a strong faith that he was prepared to bear any pain and persecution for the sake of Allah. His teacher used to beat him for his coming late. On his way back from the occult teacher, he would spend some time again with the monk and used to go home late. The family would then beat him up for being late. But he was so keen to have the company of the monk that he managed to sit regularly with the monk without fear of persecution. Through the blessings of this, Allah had gifted him with many miracles [ karamah ]. Once it happened that the boy saw a lion has blocked the path and prevented people from passing. They were perturbed. He picked a stone and prayed: "0 Allah! If the religion of the monk is true, then kill this beast with this stone [ so that people may pass ]. And if the soothsayer or magician is true, then the beast must not die with my stone." So praying, he aimed at the lion and it died instantly. The news spread among the people that the boy possesses wonderful knowledge. A blind man heard about this and came up to him. He requested him to restore his sight. The boy conceded on the condition that he embraces Islam. The blind man agreed. The boy prayed and Allah restored his sight. The blind man became Muslim. The king came to know about these incidents, and he got the boy, the monk and the blind were apprehended. They were brought before the king. He got the blind and the monk killed, and ordered that the boy be taken to the summit of a mountain and be thrown from there. But those who had taken him up there fell and died. The boy went home safely. Then the king ordered to have him drowned in the sea. The boy escaped safely, while the people who took him to the sea were drowned. The boy then himself told the king how to kill him. He told him to take an arrow from his quiver and place it in his bow, and reciting, بِاِسمِ اللہِ رَبِّی in the name of Allah, my Lord' they should shoot. They did that and they boy finally died. In this way, the boy gave his life away but seeing this, the entire nation of the king cried out spontaneously: "We believe in Allah." At this, the king was greatly enraged and, after consultation with his cabinet, ordered for deep trenches to be dug and filled with fire. An announcement was then made that the people must renounce their faith in Allah. If they refuse, they would be thrown into the fiery furnace. Eventually, a woman carrying her infant child was brought to a trench, but she hesitated. Allah granted speech to her child who said: "O mother, be steadfast, because you are certainly on the truth." In this way, many people were burned. According to some reports, about twelve thousand people were burned to ashes and, according to other reports, the number is put more than this. Consequently, Divine wrath descended on the People of the Trench and fiery furnace. Reference in verse 4 is made to this incident after taking an oath.


>Those who persecute the believing men and women and then do not repent will certainly suffer the punishment of Hell and the torment of burning. (10)

>And He is the All-Forgiving, All-Loving—Lord of the Throne, the All-Glorious, Doer of whatever He wills. (14-16)

## Surah Tariq

>Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a decisive word, and is not to be taken lightly. (13-14)

## Surah Ala

>Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High, Who created and ˹perfectly˺ fashioned ˹all˺, and Who ordained precisely and inspired accordingly, and Who brings forth ˹green˺ pasture, then reduces it to withered chaff. (1-5)


>So ˹always˺ remind ˹with the Quran˺—˹even˺ if the reminder is beneficial ˹only to some˺. Those in awe ˹of Allah˺ will be mindful ˹of it˺. (9-10)


>But it will be shunned by the most wretched, who will burn in the greatest Fire, where they will not ˹be able to˺ live or die. (11-13)

The successful in the hereafter are those pious and cognizant of God now, and the unsuccessful are those who prefer the worldly life over eternity.

>Successful indeed are those who purify themselves, remember the Name of their Lord, and pray. But you ˹deniers only˺ prefer the life of this world, even though the Hereafter is far better and more lasting. (14-17)


## Surah gkasuo8ua

The true believers are the ones who will be happy about their strife and efforts on the day of judhment

>On that Day ˹other˺ faces will be glowing with bliss, ˹fully˺ pleased with their striving, (8-9)

It goes against our religion to force conversions. We can only give the reminder. There is no compulsion in religion.

>So, ˹continue to˺ remind ˹all, O  Prophet˺, for your duty is only to remind. You are not ˹there˺ to compel them ˹to believe˺.(21-22)

## Surah fajr

Allah can test you by enriching you or by taking away from you.

> Now, whenever a human being is tested by their Lord through ˹His˺ generosity and blessings, they boast, “My Lord has ˹deservedly˺ honoured me!” But when He tests them by limiting their provision, they protest, “My Lord has ˹undeservedly˺ humiliated me!” (15-16)

The disbelievers will regret not putting something forth for their "true" life, which is the hereafter. They spent so much time amassing wealth they never donated in the worldly life that they forgot to invest into their real life, which is the hereafter.

> Absolutely not! In fact, you are not ˹even˺ gracious to the orphan, nor do you urge one another to feed the poor. And you devour ˹others’˺ inheritance greedily, and love wealth fervently.
> 
> Enough! When the earth is entirely crushed over and over, Enough! When the earth is entirely crushed over and over, and Hell is brought forth on that Day—this is when every ˹disbelieving˺ person will remember ˹their own sins˺. But what is the use of remembering then? They will cry, “I wish I had sent forth ˹something good˺ for my ˹true˺ life.” (17-24)

## Surah Balad

Allah asserts that struggling in life is an innate feature for human beings. 

> Indeed, We have created humankind in ˹constant˺ struggle. Do they think that no one has power over them, boasting, “I have wasted enormous wealth!”? Do they think that no one sees them? (4-6)

>Have We not given them two eyes, a tongue, and two lips; and shown them the two ways ˹of right and wrong˺? (8-10)

Being righteous is a challenging path but it is the only one worth walking. This path includes feeding the hungry and persevering despite difficult circumstances.

> If only they had attempted the challenging path ˹of goodness instead˺! And what will make you realize what ˹attempting˺ the challenging path is? It is to free a slave, or to give food in times of famine to an orphaned relative or to a poor person in distress,. and—above all—to be one of those who have faith and urge each other to perseverance and urge each other to compassion. (11-17)

## Surah Shams

Purifying your soul is the purpose of life, and to corrupt your soul is to wrong yourself and become a loser in the afterlife.

> Successful indeed is the one who purifies their soul, and doomed is the one who corrupts it! (9-10)

## Surah Layl

> As for the one who is charitable, mindful ˹of Allah˺, and ˹firmly˺ believes in the finest reward, We will facilitate for them the Way of Ease. (5-7)


> It is certainly upon Us ˹alone˺ to show ˹the way to˺ guidance. And surely to Us ˹alone˺ belong this life and the next. (12-13)

>But the righteous will be spared from it—who donate ˹some of˺ their wealth only to purify themselves, not in return for someone’s favours, but seeking the pleasure of their Lord, the Most High. They will certainly be pleased. (17-21)

## Surah duha

Allah guides you from ignorance and provides for you when you have nothing. He should be your everything.

> Did He not find you unguided then guided you? And did He not find you needy then satisfied your needs? (7-8)

## Surah sharh

a man has to face difficult conditions (‘usr) in the beginning, but if he perseveres with patience, this ‘usr or hardship becomes a stepping stone to new and easy circumstances (yusr). Therefore, a man should always look towards God and continue to struggle according to his capacity.

>So, surely with hardship comes ease. Surely with ˹that˺ hardship comes ˹more˺ ease. (5-6)

## Surah tin

Humans start out as innocent, pure beings, but we destroy ourselves and evenutally the majority of us end up in hell.

>Indeed, We created humans in the best form. But We will reduce them to the lowest of the low ˹in Hell˺, except those who believe and do good—they will have a never-ending reward. (4-6)

## Surah alaq

>Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous, Who taught by the pen—taught humanity what they knew not. (3-5)

## Surah qadr

talks about how laylatul wadr (night of glory) is better than 1000 nights

## Surah bayinnah

>Indeed, those who disbelieve from the People of the Book and the polytheists will be in the Fire of Hell, to stay there forever. They are the worst of ˹all˺ beings. Indeed, those who believe and do good—they are the best of ˹all˺ beings Their reward with their Lord will be Gardens of Eternity, under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This is ˹only˺ for those in awe of their Lord. (6-8)

## Surah zalzalah

>On that Day people will proceed in separate groups1 to be shown ˹the consequences of˺ their deeds. So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it. And whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.  (6-8)

## Surah adiyat

>Surely humankind is ungrateful to their Lord—and they certainly attest to this—and they are truly extreme in their love of ˹worldly˺ gains. (6-8)

## Surah qariah

>So as for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺, they will be in a life of bliss. And as for those whose scale is light, their home will be the abyss. (6-9)

## Surah takathur

Competing for money and status in this worldly life diverts you from the true purpose of life, which is to worship God.

>Competition for more ˹gains˺ diverts you ˹from Allah˺, until you end up in ˹your˺ graves. (1-2)

>Indeed, if you were to know ˹your fate˺ with certainty, ˹you would have acted differently˺. (5)


>˹But˺ you will surely see the Hellfire. Again, you will surely see it with the eye of certainty. Then, on that Day, you will definitely be questioned about ˹your worldly˺ pleasures. (6-8)

## Surah asr


> [!NOTE] 
> At every moment man is advancing towards his death. This means that if a man does not make the best of the time which is still available to him, he will finally face total destruction. In order to be successful, a man has to exert himself, while for failure he has to do nothing. It is itself rushing towards him. A venerable gentleman tells us that he understood the meaning of this chapter of the Quran from an ice vendor who was shouting in market, ‘O, people! Have mercy on one whose assets are melting away.’ On hearing this shout, the gentleman said to himself that just as the ice melts and reduces, similarly the lifespan given to man is fast passing away. If the existing opportunity is lost in inaction or in evil action, this is man’s loss. (Imam Razi, Tafsir Kabir). One who utilises his time properly is one who adopts three courses in the present world. One is that of Faith (al-ladina a’manu), i.e. consciousness of Truth or reality and its acceptance. Secondly that of virtuous deeds (wa a‘milu as-salihat), i.e. doing that which is required to be done as a matter of religious duty and abstaining from what is sinful. Thirdly that of advising people about Truth and forbearance. This follows upon such a deep realisation of Truth that the concerned person becomes its preacher.

>Surely humanity is in ˹grave˺ loss, except those who have faith, do good, and urge each other to the truth, and urge each other to perseverance. (2-3)

The only things in this life that aren't considered wasting time are these 4 things:

1. Having faith and praying to Allah
2. Doing good and benevolence
3. Urging other people to follow God and perform benevolent acts.
4. Urging other people to stay strong despite their difficulties.
