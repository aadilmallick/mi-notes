## Surah Hijr

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

The disbelievers are permitted to enjoy the worldly life until they reap what they sow on the day of judgement. 

>˹The day will come when˺ the disbelievers will certainly wish they had submitted ˹to Allah˺. ˹So˺ let them eat and enjoy themselves and be diverted by ˹false˺ hope, for they will soon know. (2-3)

>And even if We opened for them a gate to heaven, through which they continued to ascend, still they would say, “Our eyes have truly been dazzled! In fact, we must have been bewitched.” (14-15)

>Surely it is We Who give life and cause death. And We are the ˹Eternal˺ Successor. (23)

**verses 20-60**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary:** Allah tells the story about how Satan was cast away from heaven because he refused to bow down to Adam. In paradise the believers will have all malice in their heart removed and only purity will be left. 

> We have not created the heavens and the earth and everything in between except for a purpose. And the Hour is certain to come, so forgive graciously. (85)

The disbelievers will enjoy the luxuries of this life, but that's just delaying their punishment for being worldly. Do not be envious of them. 

> Do not let your eyes crave the ˹fleeting˺ pleasures We have provided for some of the disbelievers, nor grieve for them. And be gracious to the believers. (88)

Allah illustrates the importance of praying here because it serves as a reminder. 

>So glorify the praises of your Lord and be one of those who ˹always˺ pray, and worship your Lord until the inevitable1 comes your way. (98-99)

## Surah Nahl

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

>He sends down the angels with revelation by His command to whoever He wills of His servants, ˹stating:˺ “Warn ˹humanity˺ that there is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Me, so be mindful of Me ˹alone˺.” He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. Exalted is He above what they associate with Him ˹in worship˺! (2-3)

>He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. (3)

Allah has given humanity numerous blessings, like landmarks, stars, mountains, rivers, seafood, ships, food.

>If you tried to count Allah’s blessings, you would never be able to number them. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (18)

Evildoers falsely believe that they are invincible, that God will not retaliate against them. 

>Do those who devise evil plots feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them? Or that the torment will not come upon them in ways they cannot comprehend? Or that He will not seize them while they go about ˹their day˺, for then they will have no escape? Or that He will not destroy them gradually? But your Lord is truly Ever Gracious, Most Merciful. (45-47)

**verses 50-70**

>Whatever blessings you have are from Allah. Then whenever hardship touches you, to Him ˹alone˺ you cry ˹for help˺. Then as soon as He removes the hardship from you, a group of you associates ˹others˺ with their Lord ˹in worship˺, only returning Our favours with ingratitude. So enjoy yourselves, for you will soon know. (53-55)

People's inner thoughts and hurtful actions are so evil and worldly that it would immediately deserve punishment. Most people in the world are at this level of evil. Everyone makes an evil mistake, and if they were immediately punished for their sin, there would be nobody left on earth.

> If Allah were to punish people ˹immediately˺ for their wrongdoing, He would not have left a single living being on earth. But He delays them for an appointed term. And when their time arrives, they cannot delay it for a moment, nor could they advance it. (61)

>And Allah sends down rain from the sky, giving life to the earth after its death. Surely in this is a sign for those who listen. (65)

There is no meaning in life without God. Either you die young, or you die old having lost all of your knowledge and what makes you, you. 

>Allah has created you, and then causes you to die. And some of you are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Most Capable. (70)

**verses 70-80**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah illustrates in these verses the favors he has given humanity. We came out as idiot babies and then he gave us consciousness and sight. He holds the birds in the sky. He gave wool and clothing. 


One who has the opportunity to commit sin but doesn't commit it is better than the one who never had the opportunity to commit the sin in the first place. In the parable below, a free man could hoard all the wealth to himself, while the slave has no choice but to not have any wealth. The free man is faced with a bigger choice to make, and will struggle to do the right thing, while the slave has no choice and thus no struggle. 

> Allah sets forth a parable: a slave who lacks all means, compared to a ˹free˺ man to whom We granted a good provision, of which he donates ˹freely,˺ openly and secretly. Are they equal? Praise be to Allah. In fact, most of them do not know. (75)

> And Allah brought you out of the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing, and gave you hearing, sight, and intellect so perhaps you would be thankful. (78)

> Have they not seen the birds glide in the open sky? None holds them up except Allah. Surely in this are signs for those who believe. (79)

**verses 80-100**

> Indeed, Allah commands justice, grace, as well as generosity to close relatives. He forbids indecency, wickedness, and aggression. He instructs you so perhaps you will be mindful. (90)

> Honour Allah’s covenant when you make a pledge, and do not break your oaths after confirming them, having made Allah your guarantor. Surely Allah knows all you do. And do not take your oaths as a means of deceiving one another or your feet will slip after they have been firm. Then you will taste the evil ˹consequences˺ of hindering ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, and you will suffer a tremendous punishment. (91)

Never use oaths upon God as a way of one-upping each other in a conversation. It makes you more worldly and less God-fearing.

>Do not be like the woman who ˹foolishly˺ unravels her yarn after it is firmly spun, by taking your oaths as a means of deceiving one another in favour of a stronger group. Surely Allah tests you through this. And on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make your differences clear to you. (92)

> Had Allah willed, He could have easily made you one community ˹of believers˺, but He leaves to stray whoever He wills and guides whoever He wills.1 And you will certainly be questioned about what you used to do (93)

The hereafter with Allah is much better and everlasting than the temporary worldly life. Do not sin and exchange the hereafter for this brief moment. 

>And do not trade Allah’s covenant for a fleeting gain. What is with Allah is certainly far better for you, if only you knew. (95)

>Whatever you have will end, but whatever Allah has is everlasting. And We will certainly reward the steadfast according to the best of their deeds. (96)

>Whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, We will surely bless them with a good life, and We will certainly reward them according to the best of their deeds. (97)

**verses 100-end**

The disbelievers who disbelieve after belief are those who are too arrogant to believe in God, and they prefer the worldly life to the hereafter. Isn't it foolish to desire temporary years more than eternity?

>Whoever disbelieves in Allah after their belief—not those who are forced while their hearts are firm in faith, but those who embrace disbelief wholeheartedly—they will be condemned by Allah and suffer a tremendous punishment. This is because they prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter. Surely Allah never guides those who ˹choose to˺ disbelieve. They are the ones whose hearts, ears, and eyes are sealed by Allah, and it is they who are ˹truly˺ heedless. (106-108)

This is it. These are the only food items forbidden to muslims 

>He has only forbidden you ˹to eat˺ carrion, blood, swine, and what is slaughtered in the name of any other than Allah. But if someone is compelled by necessity—neither driven by desire nor exceeding immediate need—then surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (115)

>Do not falsely declare with your tongues, “This is lawful, and that is unlawful,” ˹only˺ fabricating lies against Allah. Indeed, those who fabricate lies against Allah will never succeed. (116)

>As for those who commit evil ignorantly ˹or recklessly˺, then repent afterwards and mend their ways, then your Lord is surely All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (119)

>Surely Allah is with those who shun evil and who do good ˹deeds˺. (128)

## Surah Isra

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

But man, due to his hasty nature, rushes to acquire ephemeral worldly luxuries, which prove to be impediments to his continuing his onward journey. Man’s desire for instant gratification is the greatest reason for his being deprived of the bounties of the Hereafter. This is likewise true of the world, where real success is achieved by means of patience and not by a hasty approach.

>And humans ˹swiftly˺ pray for evil1 as they pray for good. For humankind is ever hasty. (11)

>We made the day and night as two signs. So We made the sign of the night devoid of light, and We made the sign of the day ˹perfectly˺ bright, so that you may seek the bounty of your Lord and know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺. And We have explained everything in detail. (12)

Allah repeatedly stresses that choosing Islam as a way of life is only for their own good, and not choosing Islam is a way of destroying oneself because you further yourself from God. 

>Whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. And We would never punish ˹a people˺ until We have sent a messenger ˹to warn them˺. (15)

Whoever chooses the worldly life and only wants worldly desires will get what they want but at the cost of the hereafter.

>Whoever desires this fleeting world ˹alone˺, We hasten in it whatever We please to whoever We will; then We destine them for Hell, where they will burn, condemned and rejected. (18)

Others may have a better time in this world, but it is important to see past the bigger picture and focus on the hereafter. 

>See how We have favoured some over others ˹in this life˺, but the Hereafter is certainly far greater in rank and in favour (21)

It is important to honor your parents as they took care of you when you were young. 

>For your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And honour your parents. If one or both of them reach old age in your care, never say to them ˹even˺ ‘ugh,’ nor yell at them. Rather, address them respectfully. And be humble with them out of mercy, and pray, “My Lord! Be merciful to them as they raised me when I was young.” (23-24)

>Give to close relatives their due, as well as the poor and ˹needy˺ travellers. And do not spend wastefully. Surely the wasteful are ˹like˺ brothers to the devils. And the Devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord. (26-27)

>Do not be so tight-fisted, for you will be blameworthy; nor so open-handed, for you will end up in poverty. (29)

**verses 30-50**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah lists some laws to follow: 
> - Honor your parents and take care of them in old age
> - Do not be tight fisted
> - Do not be wasteful
> - Do not kill unjustly
> - Do not consume the wealth of an orphan
> - Do not follow what you have no sure knowledge of.
> - Do not be arrogant
> - Do not fall into adultery.



>Do not go near adultery. It is truly a shameful deed and an evil way. Do not take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right.1 If anyone is killed unjustly, We have given their heirs2 the authority, but do not let them exceed limits in retaliation,3 for they are already supported ˹by law˺. Give in full when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is fairest and best in the end. Do not follow what you have no ˹sure˺ knowledge of. Indeed, all will be called to account for ˹their˺ hearing, sight, and intellect. And do not walk on the earth arrogantly. Surely you can neither crack the earth nor stretch to the height of the mountains. (32-37)

>The violation of any of these ˹commandments˺ is detestable to your Lord (38)

Allah's promise is true. We will be resurrected.

>And they say ˹mockingly˺, “When we are reduced to bones and ashes, will we really be raised as a new creation?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹Yes, even if˺ you become stones, or iron, or whatever you think is harder to bring to life!” Then they will ask ˹you˺, “Who will bring us back ˹to life˺?” Say, “The One Who created you the first time.” They will then shake their heads at you and ask, “When will that be?” Say, “Perhaps it is soon!” (49-51)

>On the Day He will call you, you will ˹instantly˺ respond by praising Him,1 thinking you had remained ˹in the world˺ only for a little while. (52)


**verses 50-80**

God can invoke his wrath upon you at any moment.

>When you are touched with hardship at sea, you ˹totally˺ forget all ˹the gods˺ you ˹normally˺ invoke, except Him. But when He delivers you ˹safely˺ to shore, you turn away. Humankind is ever ungrateful. Do you feel secure that He will not cause the land to swallow you up, or unleash upon you a storm of stones? Then you will find none to protect you. Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back to sea once again, and send upon you a violent storm, drowning you for your denial? Then you will find none to avenge you against Us. (67-69)

>But whoever is blind ˹to the truth˺ in this ˹world˺ will be blind in the Hereafter, and ˹even˺ far more astray from the ˹Right˺ Way. (72)

The Fajr prayer is the most important and Tahajjud is important as well for raising your rank.

>Observe the prayer from the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and the dawn prayer, for certainly the dawn prayer is witnessed ˹by angels˺. And rise at ˹the last˺ part of the night, offering additional prayers, so your Lord may raise you to a station of praise. (78-79)

**verses 80-100**

>When We grant people Our favours, they turn away, acting arrogantly. But when touched with evil, they lose all hope. (83)

The linguistic miracle of the Quran is so great that even all of humanity working together couldn't conjure up something like it. 

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If ˹all˺ humans and jinn were to come together to produce the equivalent of this Quran, they could not produce its equal, no matter how they supported each other.” (88)

>And We have truly set forth every ˹kind of˺ lesson for humanity in this Quran, yet most people persist in disbelief. (89)

Allah says that humankind is extremely stingy, even going as far to hoard an infinite supply.

>Say ˹to them, O  Prophet˺, “Even if you were to possess the ˹infinite˺ treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, then you would certainly withhold ˹them˺, fearing they would run out—for humankind is ever stingy!” (100)
