# Juz 24

## Surah Zumar

### Summary

**verses 1-10**

>He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. He wraps the night around the day, and wraps the day around the night. And He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He is truly the Almighty, Most Forgiving. (5)

Allah predicts the discovery of the trimesters of pregnancy.

>He created you ˹all˺ from a single soul,1 then from it He made its mate.2 And He produced for you four pairs of cattle.3 He creates you in the wombs of your mothers ˹in stages˺, one development after another, in three layers of darkness.4 That is Allah—your Lord! All authority belongs to Him. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. How can you then be turned away? (6)

Allah doesn't need your belief. It's only for your own good.

> If you disbelieve, then ˹know that˺ Allah is truly not in need of you, nor does He approve of disbelief from His servants. But if you become grateful ˹through faith˺, He will appreciate that from you. No soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. He certainly knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. (7)

> When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him ˹alone˺. But as soon as He showers them with blessings from Him, they ˹totally˺ forget the One they had cried to earlier, and set up equals to Allah to mislead ˹others˺ from His Way. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while! You will certainly be one of the inmates of the Fire.” (8)

Be one of the believers who stand up during the night and pray.

>˹Are they better˺ or those who worship ˹their Lord˺ devoutly in the hours of the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of their Lord? Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” None will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason. (9)

**verses 10-30**

>Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky—channelling it through streams in the earth—then produces with it crops of various colours, then they dry up and you see them wither, and then He reduces them to chaff? Surely in this is a reminder for people of reason. (21)

>Can ˹the misguided be like˺ those whose hearts Allah has opened to Islam, so they are enlightened by their Lord? So woe to those whose hearts are hardened at the remembrance of Allah! It is they who are clearly astray. (22)

>˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ has sent down the best message—a Book of perfect consistency and repeated lessons—which causes the skin ˹and hearts˺ of those who fear their Lord to tremble, then their skin and hearts soften at the mention of ˹the mercy of˺ Allah. That is the guidance of Allah, through which He guides whoever He wills. But whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide. (23)

**verses 30-50**

>Whoever Allah leaves to stray will be left with no guide. And whoever Allah guides, none can lead astray. (36-37)

Again Allah says here that guidance is for our own God and ignoring the call of God is destruction against our own souls.

>Surely We have revealed to you the Book ˹O Prophet˺ with the truth for humanity. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. You are not a keeper over them. (41)

>˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ calls back the souls ˹of people˺ upon their death as well as ˹the souls˺ of the living during their sleep. Then He keeps those for whom He has ordained death, and releases the others until ˹their˺ appointed time. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect. (42)

It is a test from God if in hardship you beg Him to alleviate your suffering but when you are doing well in life, you feel it is all from your own effort. 

> When one is touched with hardship, they cry out to Us ˹alone˺. Then when We shower Our blessings upon them, they say, “I have been granted all this only because of ˹my˺ knowledge.” Not at all! It is ˹no more than˺ a test. But most of them do not know. (49)

**verses 50-end**

If you truly repent from a sin, then it's like you have never even committed that sin. Trust in Allah's mercy. Follow the Quran before judgement day, by then which you'll have no excuse.

> Say, ˹O Prophet, that Allah says,˺ “O My servants who have exceeded the limits against their souls! Do not lose hope in Allah’s mercy, for Allah certainly forgives all sins.1 He is indeed the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Turn to your Lord ˹in repentance˺, and ˹fully˺ submit to Him before the punishment reaches you, ˹for˺ then you will not be helped. Follow ˹the Quran,˺ the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord, before the punishment takes you by surprise while you are unaware, so that no ˹sinful˺ soul will say ˹on Judgment Day˺, ‘Woe to me for neglecting ˹my duties towards˺ Allah, while ridiculing ˹the truth˺.’ (53-56)

There is no excuse for not being righteous and God-fearing before judgement day.

>Or ˹a soul will˺ say, ‘If only Allah had guided me, I would have certainly been one of the righteous.’ Or say, upon seeing the torment, ‘If only I had a second chance, I would have been one of the good-doers.’ Not at all! My revelations had already come to you, but you rejected them, acted arrogantly, and were one of the disbelievers.” (57-59)

>And Allah will deliver those who were mindful ˹of Him˺ to their place of ˹ultimate˺ triumph. No evil will touch them, nor will they grieve. (61)

## Surah Ghafir

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

On the day of judgement, the disbelievers will plead with Allah to let them try again, but they already had their chance.

>Indeed, it will be announced to the disbelievers, “Allah’s contempt for you—as you disbelieved when invited to belief—was far worse than your contempt for one another ˹Today˺.” They will plead, “Our Lord! You made us lifeless twice, and gave us life twice.1 Now we confess our sins. So is there any way out?” ˹They will be told,˺ “˹No!˺ This is because when Allah alone was invoked, you ˹staunchly˺ disbelieved. But when others were associated with Him ˹in worship˺, you ˹readily˺ believed. So ˹Today˺ judgment belongs to Allah ˹alone˺—the Most High, All-Great.” (10-12)

Allah's justice on the day of judgement will not be injust because he has all the facts in the courtroom.

>Today every soul will be rewarded for what it has done. No injustice Today! Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.” (17)

Allah knows when you're looking at big booty buttcheeks so make sure to lower your gaze.

>Allah ˹even˺ knows the sly glances of the eyes and whatever the hearts conceal. (19)

**verses 20-60**

>O  my people! This worldly life is only ˹a fleeting˺ enjoyment, whereas the Hereafter is truly the home of settlement. Whoever does an evil deed will only be paid back with its equivalent. And whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, they will enter Paradise, where they will be provided for without limit. (39-40)

>So be patient ˹O Prophet˺, ˹for˺ Allah’s promise is certainly true. Seek forgiveness for your shortcomings.1 And glorify the praises of your Lord morning and evening. (55)

>The creation of the heavens and the earth is certainly greater than the re-creation of humankind, but most people do not know. (57)

Bad people exist on this earth. They deserve a worse fate than the righteous. Worldly people exist on this earth, indulging in whatever pleasures they want. They deserve a worse fate than the pious, who gave up worldly pleasures praying to something that they couldn't see.

>Those blind ˹to the truth˺ and those who can see are not equal, nor are those who believe and do good ˹equal˺ to those who do evil. Yet you are hardly mindful. The Hour is certainly coming, there is no doubt about it. But most people do not believe. (58-59)

Hell is for those too arrogant to pray to God.

>Your Lord has proclaimed, “Call upon Me, I will respond to you. Surely those who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hell, fully humbled.” (60)

**verses 60-end**

>It is Allah Who has made the night for you to rest in and the day bright. Surely Allah is ever Bountiful to humanity, but most people are ungrateful. (61)

>He is the One Who created you1 from dust, then from a sperm-drop,2 then ˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot,3 then He brings you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime, and become old—though some of you ˹may˺ die sooner—reaching an appointed time, so perhaps you may understand ˹Allah’s power˺. (67)

>He is the One Who gives life and causes death. When He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, “Be!” And it is! (68)

Don't be one of those people who believe only when it's too late.

>When they saw Our punishment, they cried, “˹Now˺ we believe in Allah alone and reject what we had been associating with Him!” But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our torment. This has ˹always˺ been Allah’s way ˹of dealing˺ with His ˹wicked˺ servants. Then and there the disbelievers were in ˹total˺ loss. (84-85)
