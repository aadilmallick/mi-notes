# Juz 1

## Surah baqarah

### Summary

- verses 1-10: the believers are those who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and donate their wealth. The disbelievers have a sickness in their heart, like they are blindfolded from seeing the truth. 
- verses 11-30: Allah gives proof as this book is unable to be replicated, It is a linguistic miracle. Allah also refers to his use of parables as a test for those disbelievers, as they will waste time arguing, "what does Allah mean by such a parable?" when they're entirely missing the point. In 
	- In verse 30, the angels ask God why he's creating humanity when they are evil. But he puts us there for a reason only he knows.
	>O humanity! Worship your Lord, Who created you and those before you, so that you may become mindful ˹of Him˺
	>
	>And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our servant, then produce a sûrah like it and call your helpers other than Allah, if what you say is true.
- Verses 30-40: Allah created Adam, who knew the names of all things. When Allah ordered the angels to prostrate before Adam, satan refused out of hubris. Adam picked fruit from the tree, and was sent down to earth as a punishment.
- Verses 40-50: To fulfill the covenant with Allah, we need to follow the rules he lay out for us: Establish prayer, give charity, and never deny anything in your religion for something worldly.
>	Believe in My revelations which confirm your Scriptures. Do not be the first to deny them or trade them for a fleeting gain. And be mindful of Me. Do not mix truth with falsehood or hide the truth knowingly. (41, 42)
- Verses 50-70: Story about Moses
	>Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians1—whoever ˹truly˺ believes in Allah and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. (62)
- Verses 70-90: Don't attribute lies to Allah. Allah also dispels the myth that heaven and hell are temporary. He assures they last forever. Allah points out the hypocrisy in people that pick and choose parts of scripture to follow, rejecting the rest. He also points out how stupid it is to value your temporary life over eternity. This life is a test, and a lot of people don't pass this part. 
	>Do they not know that Allah is aware of what they conceal and what they reveal? (77)
	>
> 	So woe to those who distort the Scripture with their own hands then say, “This is from Allah”—seeking a fleeting gain! So woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they have earned. 79
> 	
> 	Worship none but Allah; be kind to parents, relatives, orphans and the needy; speak kindly to people; establish prayer; and pay alms-tax. 85
> 	
> 	These are the ones who trade the Hereafter for the life of this world. So their punishment will not be reduced, nor will they be helped. 86
- Verses 90 - 120: Allah establishes that islam will have a broader acceptance for the types of people that can go to heaven. 
>		Establish prayer, and pay alms-tax. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will ˹certainly˺ find ˹its reward˺ with Allah. Surely Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. 110
