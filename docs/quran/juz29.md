# Juz 29

## Surah Mulk

### Summary

The purpose of this life is to test how we conduct ourselves in this world and how we improve our souls and if we commit more good than evil.

> ˹He is the One˺ Who created death and life in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And He is the Almighty, All-Forgiving. (2)

A study of the present world reveals a certain contradiction. The whole universe (except for human beings) is running quite perfectly and in the most well-organised manner. It has no defect in it anywhere. On the contrary, one finds many defects in human life. This is because the nature of man’s creation is different. Man in this world is living under testing conditions. A test essentially demands freedom of action. This freedom of action has given the opportunity to human beings to create disturbance and imbalance in the world. The transgression rampant in the human world is the price of human freedom. If such conditions did not exist, how could divine approval be given to those worthy persons who did not transgress, in spite of having opportunities to transgress and who abstained from arrogance in spite of having the power to be arrogant?

My personal interpretation is that although there seems to be many biological flaws like genetic mutations, those can be interpreted as just "differences" in people and animals that contribute to a more diverse atmosphere, and maybe there are moral lessons in that.

>˹He is the One˺ Who created seven heavens, one above the other. You will never see any imperfection in the creation of the Most Compassionate.1 So look again: do you see any flaws?  Then look again and again—your sight will return frustrated and weary. (3-4)

> Indeed, those in awe of their Lord without seeing Him1 will have forgiveness and a mighty reward. (12)

>Whether you speak secretly or openly—He surely knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. (13)

>How could He not know His Own creation? For He ˹alone˺ is the Most Subtle, All-Aware. (14)

Allah can send death upon you at any second. Do you still feel safe and have a plan for life? He could upend all your plans in an instant.

>Do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up as it quakes violently? Or do you feel secure that the One Who is in heaven will not unleash upon you a storm of stones. Only then would you know how ˹serious˺ My warning was! (16-17)

>Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading and folding their wings? None holds them up except the Most Compassionate. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of everything. (19)

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “He is the One Who brought you into being and gave you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks.” (23)

## Surah Qalam

The disbelievers will be asked to prostrate on the day of judgement but their backs will grow stiff and they'll be unable to do so. They didn't prostrate in the previous life and they chose not to do it, so they won't be able to do it in the hereafter along with the true believers, who have always prostrated.

>˹Beware of˺ the Day the Shin ˹of Allah˺ will be bared,1 and the wicked will be asked to prostrate, but they will not be able to do so, with eyes downcast, totally covered with disgrace. For they were ˹always˺ called to prostrate ˹in the world˺ when they were fully capable ˹but they chose not to˺. (42-43)

>So leave to Me ˹O Prophet˺ those who reject this message. We will gradually draw them to destruction in ways they cannot comprehend. I ˹only˺ delay their end for a while, but My planning is flawless. (44-45)

## Surah Haqqah

Those given their record in their right hand will be the people of paradise. Those given their record in their left hand will be the losers in the hereafter.

Your wealth and authority will mean nothing in the hereafter.

>And as for those given their record in their left hand, they will cry ˹bitterly˺, “I wish I had not been given my record, nor known anything of my reckoning! I wish death was the end! My wealth has not benefited me! My authority has been stripped from me.” (25-29)

>˹It will be said,˺ “Seize and shackle them, then burn them in Hell, then tie them up with chains seventy arms long. For they never had faith in Allah, the Greatest, nor encouraged the feeding of the poor. So this Day they will have no close friend here, nor any food except ˹oozing˺ pus, which none will eat except the evildoers.” (30-37)

The Prophet would have received a severe punishment if he had made something up.

>˹It is˺ a revelation from the Lord of all worlds. Had the Messenger made up something in Our Name, We would have certainly seized him by his right hand, then severed his aorta, and none of you could have shielded him ˹from Us˺! (43-47)

>Indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder to those mindful ˹of Allah˺. And We certainly know that some of you will persist in denial, and it will surely be a source of regret for the disbelievers. And indeed, this ˹Quran˺ is the absolute truth. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Greatest. (48-52)

## Surah Marij

The hour will come to pass undoubtedly.

>They truly see this ˹Day˺ as impossible, but We see it as inevitable. (7-8)

Humanity was created with a propensity to sin, like how they get super bummed and sulky when evil befalls them, and when they finally get a lucky break in life and get some riches, they are stingy.

> Indeed, humankind was created impatient: distressed when touched with evil, and withholding when touched with good— (19-21)

The true believers are the ones who rise above the stinginess of humanity and perform these acts:

- offer consistent prayers
- donate to chairty
- believe in the day of judgement
- fear a punishment from God
- guard their chastity

>except those who pray, consistently performing their prayers; and who give the rightful share of their wealth to the beggar and the poor; and who ˹firmly˺ believe in the Day of Judgment; and those who fear the punishment of their Lord— ˹knowing that˺ none should feel secure from their Lord’s punishment— and those who guard their chastity except with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, for then they are free from blame, but whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors. (22-31)

> ˹The faithful are˺ also those who are true to their trusts and covenants; and who are honest in their testimony; and who are ˹properly˺ observant of their prayers. (32-34)

>So, I do swear by the Lord of ˹all˺ the points of sunrise and sunset1 that We are truly capable of replacing them with ˹others˺ better than them, and We cannot be prevented ˹from doing so˺. (40-41)

Those who indulge in worldly pleasures will have quite a shock coming to them on the day of judgement.

>So let them indulge ˹in falsehood˺ and amuse ˹themselves˺ until they face their Day, which they have been threatened with— the Day they will come forth from the graves swiftly, as if racing to an idol ˹for a blessing˺, with eyes downcast, utterly covered with disgrace. That is the Day they have ˹always˺ been warned of. (42-44)

## Surah Nuh

>What is the matter with you that you are not in awe of the Majesty of Allah, when He truly created you in stages ˹of development˺? Do you not see how Allah created seven heavens, one above the other, placing the moon within them as a ˹reflected˺ light, and the sun as a ˹radiant˺ lamp? (13-16)

## Surah Jinn


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: surah jinn is about a group of jinn who heard the quran recitation and started preaching to their other fellow jinn.


>Say, “I do not know if what you are promised is near or my Lord has set a distant time for it. ˹He is the˺ Knower of the unseen, disclosing none of it to anyone, except messengers of His choice. Then He appoints angel-guards before and behind them to ensure that the messengers fully deliver the messages of their Lord—though He ˹already˺ knows all about them, and keeps account of everything.”

## Surah Muzammil

>Stand all night ˹in prayer˺ except a little—˹pray˺ half the night, or a little less, or a little more—and recite the Quran ˹properly˺ in a measured way.  (2-4)

>Indeed, worship in the night is more impactful and suitable for recitation.  For during the day you are over-occupied ˹with worldly duties˺. (6-7)

>˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord, and devote yourself to Him wholeheartedly. (8)

>And leave to Me the deniers—the people of luxury—and bear with them for a little while. ˹For˺ We certainly have shackles, a ˹raging˺ Fire, choking food, and a painful punishment ˹in store for them˺ on the Day the earth and mountains will shake ˹violently˺, and mountains will be ˹reduced to˺ dunes of shifting sand. (11-14)

The day of judgement will be so horrifying it will turn children's hairs gray from the stress.

>If you ˹pagans˺ persist in disbelief, then how will you guard yourselves against ˹the horrors of˺ a Day which will turn children’s hair grey? It will ˹even˺ cause the sky to split apart. His promise ˹of judgment˺ must be fulfilled. (17-18)

## Surah Mudatthir

Don't do a favor to somebody expecting something in return. Always endure a difficult situation for the sake of God.

>Do not do a favour expecting more ˹in return˺. And persevere for ˹the sake of˺ your Lord. (6-7)

>And what will make you realize what Hell is? It does not let anyone live or die, scorching the skin. (27-29)

Allah predicts people will needlessly argue about why there are 19 keepers over hellfire. It is a way to test the believers. The real answer is that the number doesn't matter, and only Allah knows the true number of keepers over hellfire.

>It is overseen by nineteen ˹keepers˺. We have appointed only ˹stern˺ angels as wardens of the Fire. And We have made their number only as a test for the disbelievers,1 so that the People of the Book will be certain, and the believers will increase in faith, and neither the People of the Book nor the believers will have any doubts, and so that those ˹hypocrites˺ with sickness in their hearts and the disbelievers will argue, “What does Allah mean by such a number?” In this way Allah leaves whoever He wills to stray and guides whoever He wills. And none knows the forces of your Lord except He. And this ˹description of Hell˺ is only a reminder to humanity. (30-31)

>Surely Hell is one of the mightiest catastrophes—a warning to humankind, to whichever of you chooses to take the lead or lag behind. (35-37)

Advice, howsoever reasonable and well-supported by arguments, can be effective only when the hearer is serious about it. If the hearer is not serious, the advice will not reach his heart. Such arguments as deeply move a serious-minded person, will only cause a frivolous person to engage in meaningless discussions.

>But no! In fact, they do not fear the Hereafter. Enough! Surely this ˹Quran˺ is a reminder. So let whoever wills be mindful of it. (53-55)

## Surah Qiyamah

>Do people think We cannot reassemble their bones? Yes ˹indeed˺! We are ˹most˺ capable of restoring ˹even˺ their very fingertips. (3-4)

>But no! In fact, you love this fleeting world, and neglect the Hereafter. (20-21)

God put you on this earth for a reason. Do not be one of the disbelievers thinking there is nothing beyond this worldly life and there is no purpose to life. 

>Do people think they will be left without purpose? (36)

## Surah insan

The believers give their food to the hungry despite their own desire for it.

>They ˹are those who˺ fulfil ˹their˺ vows and fear a Day of sweeping horror, and give food—despite their desire for it—to the poor, the orphan, and the captive, ˹saying to themselves,˺ “We feed you only for the sake of Allah, seeking neither reward nor thanks from you. (7-9)


>˹Always˺ remember the Name of your Lord morning and evening, and prostrate before Him during part of the night,1 and glorify Him long at night (25-26)

## Surah Mursalat

>˹They will be told by Allah,˺ “This is the Day of ˹Final˺ Decision: We have gathered you along with earlier disbelievers ˹for punishment˺. So if you have a scheme ˹to save yourselves˺, then use it against Me.” (38-39)
