## Surah Muminun

### Summary

**verses 1-10**

In this world of God, success is for one who is a true believer, one who devotes himself fully to God and not to anybody other than God, and who leads a God-oriented life. Realisation of God is not a simple matter. It brings about a revolution in the life of a man. He becomes a worshipper of God and bows down before Him in submission. His sincerity and seriousness increase to the extent that wasting time in useless pursuits appears fatal to him. He sets aside a portion of his earnings in the name of God and with that he helps the needy. He exercises control over his sexual desires and gives free rein to them only within the limit prescribed by God for the purpose. He lives his life in this world as a responsible person and never misappropriates whatever is entrusted to him. Such a man never dishonours any pledge undertaken by him. Those who possess these qualities are the favoured subjects of God. These are the people for whom God has kept ready the ideal world, namely, the gardens of Paradise. After death they will be sent into this sublime atmosphere so that they may savour its joys forever.

>Successful indeed are the believers: those who humble themselves in prayer; those who avoid idle talk; those who pay alms-tax; those who guard their chastity except with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession,1 for then they are free from blame but whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors; ˹the believers are also˺ those who are true to their trusts and covenants; These are the ones who will be awarded Paradise as their own.1 They will be there forever. (1-11)

>We send down rain from the sky in perfect measure, causing it to soak into the earth. And We are surely able to take it away. (18)

**verses 50-70**

Religion is originally one, and the same religion was taught to all the prophets. Religion enhances man spiritually so that he may discover God as an Almighty Being. His mind and soul should be imbued with the idea of the one God, Who is watching his every move, and after his death will take a reckoning of all his deeds. This realization (ma‘rifah) is the real religion. As a man enters the fold of realization, he begins to adopt righteous and pious methods in all his affairs. The realization of God essentially results in fear of God, and fear of God necessarily results in a pious life.

>Surely this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your Lord, so fear Me ˹alone˺. Yet the people have divided it into different sects, each rejoicing in what they have. (52-53)

>Do they think, since We provide them with wealth and children, that We hasten to ˹honour˺ them ˹with˺ all kinds of good? No! They are not aware. (55-56)

>Surely those who tremble in awe of their Lord, and who believe in the revelations of their Lord, and who associate none with their Lord, and who do whatever ˹good˺ they do with their hearts fearful, ˹knowing˺ that they will return to their Lord— it is they who race to do good deeds, always taking the lead. (57-61)

One whose discovery of God is such that he is awe-struck by Him becomes different from other men, in that his God-fearing mentality makes him extremely serious. His seriousness guarantees that he fully realises the weight of divine proofs and he submits to God completely. In the present world, there are two ways in which a man may exert himself — one is the way of the world and the other is the way of the Hereafter. Those who possess the above-mentioned qualities, are exactly those who strive towards the Hereafter. However, in the present world, to strive towards the Hereafter is an extremely difficult task. It is one in which a man is prone to different types of shortcomings. But, Almighty God’s requirement of every man is exactly commensurate with his capacity to fulfill it. Everybody’s capacity and performance are both completely within the knowledge of God and this very fact ensures that, on the Day of Judgement, everyone will receive whatever concession he is justifiably entitled to and everyone will receive the reward which he actually deserves.

>We never require of any soul more than what it can afford. And with Us is a record which speaks the truth. None will be wronged. (62)

**verses 70-80**

Most people who are doubtful of Islam are just doubtful because they want to mold the truth to fit their needs. Those are people who want worldly desires more than the actual truth.

>Or ˹because˺ they say, “He is insane?” In fact, he has come to them with the truth, but most of them are resentful of the truth. Had the truth followed their desires,1 the heavens, the earth, and all those in them would have certainly been corrupted. In fact, We have brought them ˹the means to˺ their glory, but they turn away from it. (70-71)

>˹Even˺ if We had mercy on them and removed their affliction,1 they would still persist in their transgression, wandering blindly. And We have already seized them with torment, but they never humbled themselves to their Lord, nor did they ˹submissively˺ appeal ˹to Him˺. (75-76)

>He is the One Who created for you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks. (78)

>And He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and to Him belongs the alternation of the day and night. Will you not then understand? (80)

**verses 80-end**

Allah disproves the notion of multiple gods being able to exist.

>Allah has never had ˹any˺ offspring, nor is there any god besides Him. Otherwise, each god would have taken away what he created, and they would have tried to dominate one another. Glorified is Allah above what they claim! (91)

>When death approaches any of them, they cry, “My Lord! Let me go back, so I may do good in what I left behind.” Never! It is only a ˹useless˺ appeal they make. And there is a barrier behind them until the Day they are resurrected.1 (99-100)

>As for those whose scale is heavy ˹with good deeds˺, it is they who will be successful. But those whose scale is light, they will have doomed themselves, staying in Hell forever. (102-103)

Allah assures us that we were created for a purpose.

> Did you then think that We had created you without purpose, and that you would never be returned to Us? (115)

> [!NOTE]

> - Premarital sex garners 100 lashes
> - Adultery garners death by stoning

>A male fornicator would only marry a female fornicator or idolatress. And a female fornicator would only be married to a fornicator or idolater. This is ˹all˺ forbidden to the believers (3)

Those who love sowing discord among muslims are indecent human beings.

>Indeed, those who love to see indecency spread among the believers will suffer a painful punishment in this life and the Hereafter. Allah knows and you do not know. (19)

>˹You would have suffered,˺ had it not been for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, and had Allah not been Ever Gracious, Most Merciful. (20)

**verses 20-30**

Allah discourages against stopping donations to people who have angered you. Forgive them as Allah has forgiven you.  In Islam, help is to be given to needy persons on account of their being needy and not on any other grounds.

This verse is in relation to Abu Bakr stopping giving money to Mistah, the slanderer of Aisha. Allah urges him to continue giving to Mistah because Mistah is needy.

>Do not let the people of virtue and affluence among you swear to suspend donations to their relatives, the needy, and the emigrants in the cause of Allah. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love to be forgiven by Allah? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.1 (21)

>Surely those who accuse chaste, unsuspecting,1 believing women are cursed in this life and the Hereafter. And they will suffer a tremendous punishment on the Day their tongues, hands, and feet will testify against them for what they used to do. (23-24)

>Wicked women are for wicked men, and wicked men are for wicked women. And virtuous women are for virtuous men, and virtuous men are for virtuous women. The virtuous are innocent of what the wicked say. They will have forgiveness and an honourable provision (26)

>O believers! Do not enter any house other than your own until you have asked for permission and greeted its occupants. This is best for you, so perhaps you will be mindful. If you find no one at home, do not enter it until you have been given permission. And if you are asked to leave, then leave. That is purer for you. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of what you do. (27-28)

>˹O Prophet!˺ Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their chastity. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do. (30)

**verses 30-50**

>Do you not see that Allah is glorified by all those in the heavens and the earth, even the birds as they soar? Each ˹instinctively˺ knows their manner of prayer and glorification. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all they do. (41)

>And Allah has created from water every living creature. Some of them crawl on their bellies, some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. Allah creates whatever He wills. Surely Allah is Most Capable of everything. (45)

## Surah Furqan

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

In this surah, Allah stands by his decision to send down the prophets as human beings and not angels.

>And they say ˹mockingly˺, “What kind of messenger is this who eats food and goes about in market-places ˹for a living˺? If only an angel had been sent down with him to be his co-warner, or a treasure had been cast down to him, or he had had a garden from which he may eat!” And the wrongdoers say ˹to the believers˺, “You are only following a bewitched man.” (7-8)

>We never sent any messenger before you ˹O Prophet˺, who did not eat food and go about in market-places. We have made some of you a trial for others. Will you ˹not then˺ be patient? And your Lord is All-Seeing. (20)

**verses 20-60**

>The disbelievers say, “If only the Quran had been sent down to him all at once!” ˹We have sent it˺ as such ˹in stages˺ so We may reassure your heart with it. And We have revealed it at a deliberate pace. (32)

Allah likens the person who puts their own desires above all else as nothing less than cattle. That is how stunted their spiritual growth is. The true human being is the one who can rise above his desires.

>Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ the one who has taken their own desires as their god? Will you then be a keeper over them? (43)

>Or do you think that most of them listen or understand?1 They are only like cattle—no, more than that, they are astray from the ˹Right˺ Way! (44)

>And He is the One Who creates human beings from a ˹humble˺ liquid,1 then establishes for them bonds of kinship and marriage. For your Lord is Most Capable. (54)

**verses 60-80**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: IN these verses, Allah describes the attributes of the believers and the disbelievers.
> 
> Attributes of the belivers:
> - Respond kindly to rude people instead of being rude back
> - They are not arrogant
> - They pray during the night and are afraid of hell
> - Spend moderately, not being stingy
> - They don't kill people
> - They don't fornicate
> - They are not polytheists



> The ˹true˺ servants of the Most Compassionate are those who walk on the earth humbly, and when the foolish address them ˹improperly˺, they only respond with peace. ˹They are˺ those who spend ˹a good portion of˺ the night, prostrating themselves and standing before their Lord. ˹They are˺ those who pray, “Our Lord! Keep the punishment of Hell away from us, for its punishment is indeed unrelenting. It is certainly an evil place to settle and reside.” ˹They are˺ those who spend neither wastefully nor stingily, but moderately in between. ˹They are˺ those who do not invoke any other god besides Allah, nor take a ˹human˺ life—made sacred by Allah—except with ˹legal˺ right,1 nor commit fornication. And whoever does ˹any of˺ this will face the penalty. Their punishment will be multiplied on the Day of Judgment, and they will remain in it forever, in disgrace. (63 - 69)

> As for those who repent, believe, and do good deeds, they are the ones whose evil deeds Allah will change into good deeds. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (70)

>And whoever repents and does good has truly turned to Allah properly. ˹They are˺ those who do not bear false witness, and when they come across falsehood, they pass ˹it˺ by with dignity. ˹They are˺ those who, when reminded of the revelation of their Lord, do not turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to it. ˹They are˺ those who pray, “Our Lord! Bless us with ˹pious˺ spouses and offspring who will be the joy of our hearts, and make us models for the righteous.” (76)

Our lives do not matter to God unless we turn in remembrance and love towards him.

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “You ˹all˺ would not ˹even˺ matter to my Lord were it not for your faith ˹in Him˺. But now you ˹disbelievers˺ have denied ˹the truth˺, so the torment is bound to come.” (77)
