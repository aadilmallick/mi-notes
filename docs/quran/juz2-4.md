# Juz 2-4

## Surah Imran

### Summary

**Verses 1-10**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah starts off with a banger saying that he is confirming the truth of the Torah and Gospel, and also saying that he created both clear and unclear verses so as he can test who believes and disbelieves.


>Surely nothing on earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah. (5)

The disbelievers will focus on false interpretations and will try to take stuff either too literally or completely misunderstand verses in order to further their agenda. The people of reason are those who believe in the Quran.

>He is the One Who has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book, of which some verses are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—while others are elusive.1 Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses seeking ˹to spread˺ doubt through their ˹false˺ interpretations—but none grasps their ˹full˺ meaning except Allah. As for those well-grounded in knowledge, they say, “We believe in this ˹Quran˺—it is all from our Lord.” But none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason. ˹They say,˺ “Our Lord! Do not let our hearts deviate after you have guided us. Grant us Your mercy. You are indeed the Giver ˹of all bounties˺. (7-8)

>Our Lord! You will certainly gather all humanity for the ˹promised˺ Day—about which there is no doubt. Surely Allah does not break His promise.” (9)

>Indeed, neither the wealth nor children1 of the disbelievers will be of any benefit to them against Allah—and they will be the fuel for the Fire. (10)


**Verses 10-30**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah says that this worldly life is nothing but a delusion, and that the hereafter is better than this life. He also says that Islam is the only acceptable religion. People also believe that they will only be in hellfire temporarily, but Allah denies that saying their punishment is eternal. 

> The enjoyment of ˹worldly˺ desires—women, children,1 treasures of gold and silver, fine horses, cattle, and fertile land—has been made appealing to people. These are the pleasures of this worldly life, but with Allah is the finest destination. (14)

>˹It is they˺ who are patient, sincere, obedient, and charitable, and who pray for forgiveness before dawn. (17)

The day of judgment is also the day of justice. Every person's actions will be fully accounted for. So before that day, make sure to do good.

>But how ˹horrible˺ will it be when We gather them together on the Day about which there is no doubt—when every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and none will be wronged! (25)

>You cause the night to pass into the day and the day into the night. You bring forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. And You provide for whoever You will without limit.” (27)

>˹Watch for˺ the Day when every soul will be presented with whatever good it has done. And it will wish that its misdeeds were far off. And Allah warns you about Himself. And Allah is Ever Gracious to ˹His˺ servants. (30)

**Verses 30-60**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Zachariah raised Mary, a righteous woman. Zachariah asks Allah to give him a son, and then Allah accepts gives him a son called Yahya (John). Allah says he has chosen Mary over all other woman of the world.

>Then and there Zachariah prayed to his Lord, saying, “My Lord! Grant me—by your grace—righteous offspring. You are certainly the Hearer of ˹all˺ prayers.” So the angels called out to him while he stood praying in the sanctuary, “Allah gives you good news of ˹the birth of˺ John who will confirm the Word of Allah and will be a great leader, chaste, and a prophet among the righteous.” Zachariah exclaimed, “My Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old and my wife is barren?” He replied, “So will it be. Allah does what He wills.” (38-40)

Allah says to the prophet pbuh that he did not know these stories before.

>This is news of the unseen that We reveal to you ˹O Prophet˺. You were not with them when they cast lots to decide who would be Mary’s guardian, nor were you there when they argued ˹about it˺.

Jesus was born of a virgin birth and can speak to people in his infancy.

>Mary wondered, “My Lord! How can I have a child when no man has ever touched me?” An angel replied, “So will it be. Allah creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He simply tells it, ‘Be!’ And it is!

>And the disbelievers made a plan ˹against Jesus˺, but Allah also planned—and Allah is the best of planners. (54)

>Indeed, the example of Jesus in the sight of Allah is like that of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him, “Be!” And he was! This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt. (59)

**verses 60 to 80**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: The Jews and Christians keep trying to claim Abraham for themselves, and Allah tells them to stop arguing about things which they have no knowledge of. Allah asserts that Abraham did not adhere to any one religion - he was just a monotheist. 

It is imprudent to argue about things you have no knowledge of.

>Here you are! You disputed about what you have ˹little˺ knowledge of,1 but why do you now argue about what you have no knowledge of?2 Allah knows and you do not know. (66)

>Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian; he submitted in all uprightness1 and was not a polytheist. (67)

> He chooses whoever He wills to receive His mercy. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty. (74)

Some people adhere to their religion without understanding the core tenets of monotheism and doing good no matter what. They use religion as an excuse to withhold money and do evil.

>There are some among the People of the Book who, if entrusted with a stack of gold, will readily return it. Yet there are others who, if entrusted with a single coin, will not repay it unless you constantly demand it. This is because they say, “We are not accountable for ˹exploiting˺ the Gentiles.”1 And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly. (75)

Allah says that those who breaks Allah's laws for monetary or worldly means will have no share of heaven. There are also people who distort the religious books and attribute lies to God. 

>Indeed, those who trade Allah’s covenant and their oaths for a fleeting gain will have no share in the Hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them, nor look at them, nor purify them on the Day of Judgment. And they will suffer a painful punishment. (77)

>There are some among them who distort the Book with their tongues to make you think this ˹distortion˺ is from the Book—but it is not what the Book says. They say, “It is from Allah”—but it is not from Allah. And ˹so˺ they attribute lies to Allah knowingly. (78)

**verses 80-90**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah says that submitting to God is the only way to lead a good life. Disbelief after belief is rebellion and stupidity. Allah is harsh towards to keep going back to disbelief after belief. Those people will never be forgiven nor enter heaven. 

>Do they desire a way other than Allah’s—knowing that all those in the heavens and the earth submit to His Will, willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will ˹all˺ be returned? (83)

>Whoever seeks a way other than Islam,1 it will never be accepted from them, and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers. (85)

**verses 90-100**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah says that righteousness is donating what you cherish. He knows everything you do. Your deeds, your hypocrisy, and what's in your heart.

>You will never achieve righteousness until you donate some of what you cherish. And whatever you give is certainly well known to Allah. (92)

Allah's majesty is not reduced whatsoever if you disbelieve. You are not hurting God in the slightest. Believing is only for your own benefit. 

>And whoever disbelieves, then surely Allah is not in need of ˹any of His˺ creation. (97)

There are some people who turn other people away from Islam by striving to make it appear rigid and crooked, even when they believe in Islam itself. They are hypocrites. 

>Say, “O People of the Book! Why do you turn the believers away from the Way of Allah—striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked, while you are witnesses ˹to its truth˺? And Allah is never unaware of what you do.” (99)

**verses 100 - 110**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah encourages unity in worshipping him, as he unites people. Join one another in enacting good and forbidding evil, and do not split into sects. 

> O believers! Be mindful of Allah in the way He deserves, and do not die except in ˹a state of full˺ submission ˹to Him˺. (102)

>And hold firmly together to the rope of Allah1 and do not be divided. Remember Allah’s favour upon you when you were enemies, then He united your hearts, so you—by His grace—became brothers. And you were at the brink of a fiery pit and He saved you from it. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to you, so that you may be ˹rightly˺ guided. (103)

Allah does not like those who split into sects even after clear proofs come to them about the importance of unity. 

>Let there be a group among you who call ˹others˺ to goodness, encourage what is good, and forbid what is evil—it is they who will be successful. And do not be like those who split ˹into sects˺ and differed after clear proofs had come to them. It is they who will suffer a tremendous punishment. (104-105)

>On that Day some faces will be bright while others gloomy. To the gloomy-faced it will be said, “Did you disbelieve after having believed? So taste the punishment for your disbelief.” As for the bright-faced, they will be in Allah’s mercy, where they will remain forever. (106-107)

> And Allah desires no injustice to ˹His˺ creation. (108)

**verses 110-120**

Allah says that some people of the book are true believers, as they race to do good and they prostrate in prayer. 

>Yet they are not all alike: there are some among the People of the Book who are upright, who recite Allah’s revelations throughout the night, prostrating ˹in prayer˺. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, encourage good and forbid evil, and race with one another in doing good. They are ˹truly˺ among the righteous. They will never be denied the reward for any good they have done. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of those mindful ˹of Him˺. (113-115)

**verses 120-140**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah encourages righteousness and doing good as the reward for doing good is Paradise

>˹They are˺ those who donate in prosperity and adversity, control their anger, and pardon others. And Allah loves the good-doers. ˹They are˺ those who, upon committing an evil deed or wronging themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins—and who forgives sins except Allah?—and they do not knowingly persist in wrongdoing? Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens under which rivers flow, staying there forever. How excellent is the reward for those who work ˹righteousness˺! (134 - 136)


Allah says to not grieve at the legions of disbelievers who were destroyed. Instead, take it as a warning to not follow in their path.

>Do not falter or grieve, for you will have the upper hand, if you are ˹true˺ believers.

**verses 140-150**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: When the coveted opportunity for martyrdom is at the fingertips of the muslims, they hesitate because they fear death. They also hesitate once they hear the prophet pbuh has died at the battle of Uhud, and Allah admonishes them for thinking the religion is over just because a single man died. Allah says, "Muhammad is no more than a messenger."

>Do you think you will enter Paradise without Allah proving which of you ˹truly˺ struggled ˹for His cause˺ and patiently endured? (142)

People think they want to be martyrs, but once they actually see death, they are scared of it.

>You certainly wished ˹for the opportunity˺ for martyrdom before encountering it, now you have seen it with your own eyes. (143)

>Muḥammad is no more than a messenger; other messengers have gone before him. If he were to die or to be killed, would you regress into disbelief? Those who do so will not harm Allah whatsoever. And Allah will reward those who are grateful. (144)

> No soul can ever die without Allah’s Will at the destined time. Those who desire worldly gain, We will let them have it, and those who desire heavenly reward, We will grant it to them. And We will reward those who are grateful. (145)

Allah praises the true believers, the ones who want to be martyred. 

>˹Imagine˺ how many devotees fought along with their prophets and never faltered despite whatever ˹losses˺ they suffered in the cause of Allah, nor did they weaken or give in! Allah loves those who persevere. And all they said was, “Our Lord! Forgive our sins and excesses, make our steps firm, and grant us victory over the disbelieving people.” So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the excellent reward of the Hereafter. For Allah loves the good-doers. (146 - 148)

**verses 150-160**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah scolds the people who were afraid to die at Uhud, thinking they could change fate and instead wanting a fleeting gain in this world. Allah establishes martyrdom as a far better reward than anything worldly in this life.

At the battle of Uhud, people were scared and regressed backed to disbelief. They questioned the divine destiny of Allah and wondered if they could escape death at Uhud. Allah responds by saying they would have met the same fate anyway. 

>Then after distress, He sent down serenity in the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were disturbed by evil thoughts about Allah—the thoughts of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “All matters are destined by Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. (154)

>O believers! Do not be like the unfaithful1 who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” Allah makes such thinking a cause of agony in their hearts. It is Allah who gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. (156)

>Should you be martyred or die in the cause of Allah, then His forgiveness and mercy are far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ those ˹who stay behind˺ accumulate. Whether you die or are martyred—all of you will be gathered before Allah. (157 - 158)

>If Allah helps you, none can defeat you. But if He denies you help, then who else can help you? So in Allah let the believers put their trust. (160)

**verses 160-180**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah reveals that he made the battle of Uhud a difficult battle full of casualties as to test the believers and separate the hypocrites from the true believers. Allah rewarded people for their intentions. If the enemy boasted about their number and they still stood their ground despite that, then Allah protected them from harm because they proved their faith. Allah says that people should not fear death or being harmed - they should fear God most.

>Are those who seek Allah’s pleasure like those who deserve Allah’s wrath? Hell is their home. What an evil destination! (162)

>When it was said to them, “Come fight in the cause of Allah or ˹at least˺ defend yourselves,” they replied, “If we had known there was fighting, we would have definitely gone with you.” They were closer to disbelief than to belief on that day—for saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts. Allah is All-Knowing of what they hide. (167)

Death is something inescapable. If Allah wills you to die, then you will die. Therefore trying to avoid being killed in battles is something foolish because in the end you will never actually escape death.

>Those who sat at home, saying about their brothers, “Had they listened to us, they would not have been killed.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Try not to die1 if what you say is true!” (168)

>Never think of those martyred in the cause of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive with their Lord, well provided for - rejoicing in Allah’s bounties and being delighted for those yet to join them. There will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. (169-170)

Do not fear being killed. Instead fear Allah.

>Those who were warned, “Your enemies have mobilized their forces against you, so fear them,” the warning only made them grow stronger in faith and they replied, “Allah ˹alone˺ is sufficient ˹as an aid˺ for us and ˹He˺ is the best Protector.” So they returned with Allah’s favours and grace, suffering no harm. For they sought to please Allah. And surely Allah is ˹the˺ Lord of infinite bounty. That ˹warning˺ was only ˹from˺ Satan, trying to prompt you to fear his followers.1 So do not fear them; fear Me if you are ˹true˺ believers. (173-175)

>Those who trade belief for disbelief will never harm Allah in the least, and they will suffer a painful punishment. Those who disbelieve should not think that living longer is good for them. They are only given more time to increase in sin, and they will suffer a humiliating punishment. (177 - 178)

**verses 180 - 190**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah urges us to understand that this world is nothing but a delusion, and stuff like wealth and bad deeds will ruin us on the day of judgement. Everything we do in this life is preparation for the day of judgement.

Do not withhold the spoils of war and anything you earn. Wealth is poison that will weigh you down on the day of judgement.

>And do not let those who ˹greedily˺ withhold Allah’s bounties think it is good for them—in fact, it is bad for them! They will be leashed ˹by their necks˺ on the Day of Judgment with whatever ˹wealth˺ they used to withhold. And Allah is the ˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. (180)

>Every soul will taste death. And you will only receive your full reward on the Day of Judgment. Whoever is spared from the Fire and is admitted into Paradise will ˹indeed˺ triumph, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment. (185)

>You ˹believers˺ will surely be tested in your wealth and yourselves,1 and you will certainly hear many hurtful words from those who were given the Scripture before you and ˹from˺ the polytheists. But if you are patient and mindful ˹of Allah˺—surely this is a resolve to aspire to. (186)

Taking credit for your bad deeds is worse than just committing them because it shows you have no remorse. 

>Do not let those who rejoice in their misdeeds and love to take credit for what they have not done think they will escape torment. They will suffer a painful punishment. (188)

>Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the day and night there are signs for people of reason. (190)

**verses 190 - 200**

> ˹They are˺ those who remember Allah while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth ˹and pray˺, “Our Lord! You have not created ˹all of˺ this without purpose. Glory be to You! Protect us from the torment of the Fire. (191)

>So their Lord responded to them: “I will never deny any of you—male or female—the reward of your deeds. Both are equal in reward. Those who migrated or were expelled from their homes, and were persecuted for My sake and fought and ˹some˺ were martyred—I will certainly forgive their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, as a reward from Allah. And with Allah is the finest reward!” (195)

Disbelievers may seem to do great in this world - financial success, fun drinking alcohol, love and premarital relationships, but that's only a brief enjoyment before the day of judgement. 

>Do not be deceived by the prosperity of the disbelievers throughout the land. It is only a brief enjoyment. Then Hell will be their home—what an evil place to rest! (196-197)

>Indeed, there are some among the People of the Book who truly believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you ˹believers˺ and what was revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah—never trading Allah’s revelations for a fleeting gain. Their reward is with their Lord. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning. (199)

>O believers! Patiently endure, persevere, stand on guard,1 and be mindful of Allah, so you may be successful. (200)
