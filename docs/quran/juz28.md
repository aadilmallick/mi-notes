# Juz 28

## Surah Mujadila

>Do you not see that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth? If three converse privately, He is their fourth. If five, He is their sixth. Whether fewer or more, He is with them1 wherever they may be. Then, on the Day of Judgment, He will inform them of what they have done. Surely Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. (7)

>Have you not seen those who were forbidden from secret talks, yet they ˹always˺ return to what they were forbidden from, conspiring in sin, aggression, and disobedience to the Messenger? And when they come to you ˹O Prophet˺, they greet you not as Allah greets you,1 and say to one another, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough for them—they will burn in it. And what an evil destination! (8)

>O believers! When you converse privately, let it not be for sin, aggression, or disobedience to the Messenger, but let it be for goodness and righteousness. And fear Allah, to Whom you will ˹all˺ be gathered. (9)

>You will never find a people who ˹truly˺ believe in Allah and the Last Day loyal to those who defy Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their parents, children, siblings, or extended family. For those ˹believers˺, Allah has instilled faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him.1 He will admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Indeed, Allah’s party is bound to succeed. (22)

## Surah Hashr

The hypocrites are the ones who fear other human beings more than they fear God.

>Indeed, there is more fear in their hearts for you ˹believers˺ than for Allah. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend. (13)

Those who forget Allah forget themselves.

>And do not be like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget themselves. It is they who are ˹truly˺ rebellious. (19)

>Had We sent down this Quran upon a mountain, you would have certainly seen it humbled and torn apart in awe of Allah. We set forth such comparisons for people, ˹so˺ perhaps they may reflect. (21)

>He is Allah—there is no god except Him: the King, the Most Holy, the All-Perfect, the Source of Serenity, the Watcher ˹of all˺, the Almighty, the Supreme in Might,1 the Majestic. Glorified is Allah far above what they associate with Him ˹in worship˺! He is Allah: the Creator, the Inventor, the Shaper. He ˹alone˺ has the Most Beautiful Names. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth ˹constantly˺ glorifies Him. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise. (24)

## Surah Mumtahanah

You are responsible for your own deeds, nobody else's. You can't seek good deeds or salvation from people related to you. It has to come from you.

>Neither your relatives nor children will benefit you on Judgment Day—He will decide between you ˹all˺. For Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. (3)

There is no requirement to kill disbelievers who didn't want to fight.

>Allah does not forbid you from dealing kindly and fairly with those who have neither fought nor driven you out of your homes. Surely Allah loves those who are fair. Allah only forbids you from befriending those who have fought you for ˹your˺ faith, driven you out of your homes, or supported ˹others˺ in doing so. And whoever takes them as friends, then it is they who are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers. (8-9)

## Surah Saf

Allah hates those hypocrites who say one thing and then do another.

In the universe, with the exception of the conduct of human beings, there is no inconsistency anywhere. In this world wood is always wood and anything which has the appearance of being iron or stone will be iron or stone in actual experience. Man should also be like this. There should be consistency in a man’s sayings and doings, even if he is required to pay the price of facing all sorts of difficulties and has to become exceptionally patient.

>O believers! Why do you say what you do not do? How despicable it is in the sight of Allah that you say what you do not do! (2-3)

If you believe in Allah and his messenger and strive in his cause with your lives and wealth, he will save you from the hellfire.

>O believers! Shall I guide you to an exchange that will save you from a painful punishment? ˹It is to˺ have faith in Allah and His Messenger, and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if only you knew. He will forgive your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and ˹house you in˺ splendid homes in the Gardens of Eternity. That is the ultimate triumph. (10-12)

## Surah Jumah

It is no good to subscribe to a religion and then not follow its practices. It's as useless as giving a donkey a book. It could never read nor understand the book, so what's the point?

>The example of those who were entrusted with ˹observing˺ the Torah but failed to do so, is that of a donkey carrying books.1 How evil is the example of those who reject Allah’s signs! For Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. (5)

>O believers! When the call to prayer is made on Friday, then proceed ˹diligently˺ to the remembrance of Allah and leave off ˹your˺ business. That is best for you, if only you knew. Once the prayer is over, disperse throughout the land and seek the bounty of Allah. And remember Allah often so you may be successful. (9-10)

## Surah Munafiqun

Fucking bar from Allah here:

>When the hypocrites come to you ˹O Prophet˺, they say, “We bear witness that you are certainly the Messenger of Allah”—and surely Allah knows that you are His Messenger—but Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are truly liars. (1)

>This is because they believed and then abandoned faith. Therefore, their hearts have been sealed, so they do not comprehend. (3)

The hypocrites are all talk, no action. They have no substance to them.

>When you see them, their appearance impresses you. And when they speak, you listen to their ˹impressive˺ speech. But they are ˹just˺ like ˹worthless˺ planks of wood leaned ˹against a wall˺. They think every cry is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah condemn them! How can they be deluded ˹from the truth˺? (4)

>When it is said to them, “Come! The Messenger of Allah will pray for you to be forgiven,” they turn their heads ˹in disgust˺, and you see them ˹O Prophet˺ turn away in arrogance. It is the same whether you pray for their forgiveness or not, Allah will not forgive them. Surely Allah does not guide the rebellious people. (5-6)

Allah urges us to not let the worldly life divert us from the remembrance of God, and to donate before death takes us so we can be of the righteous.

> O believers! Do not let your wealth or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. For whoever does so, it is they who are the ˹true˺ losers. (9)

> And donate from what We have provided for you before death comes to one of you, and you cry, “My Lord! If only You delayed me for a short while, I would give in charity and be one of the righteous.” (10)

> But Allah never delays a soul when its appointed time comes. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. (11)

## Surah Taghabun

>He is the One Who created you, yet some of you are disbelievers while some are believers. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do. (2)

He asserts again that Allah created the universe for a purpose.

> He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. He shaped you ˹in the womb˺, perfecting your form. And to Him is the final return. (3)

> He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And He knows whatever you conceal and whatever you reveal. For Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. (4)

>˹Consider˺ the Day He will gather you ˹all˺ for the Day of Gathering—that will be the Day of mutual loss and gain. So whoever believes in Allah and does good, He will absolve them of their sins and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. That is the ultimate triumph. (9)

No trouble arrives of its own accord. Every tribulation comes from God, and it afflicts man so that, through it, he should receive guidance. Trouble softens a man’s heart and jolts him out of his moral slumber. Trouble prods and sharpens a man’s mind. If he refrains from negative reaction, then trouble will become the best Divine instruction for him.

This verse below also shows how adversity in life is inevitable, whether or not we are believers. But what we can change is how we react to adversity.

>No calamity befalls ˹anyone˺ except by Allah’s Will. And whoever has faith in Allah, He will ˹rightly˺ guide their hearts ˹through adversity˺. And Allah has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. (11)

>O believers! Indeed, some of your spouses and children are enemies to you,1 so beware of them. But if you pardon, overlook, and forgive ˹their faults˺, then Allah is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (14)

Your children are a test. Your wealth is a test. Stop comparing your Indian children to each other and stop flexing your bank account. It is all a test.

>Your wealth and children are only a test, but Allah ˹alone˺ has a great reward. (15)

Being selfish is destructive to your own soul while being unselflish saves your soul. Anything you donate Allah will give back to you many times over.

> So be mindful of Allah to the best of your ability, hear and obey, and spend in charity—that will be best for you. And whoever is saved from the selfishness of their own souls, it is they who are ˹truly˺ successful. (16)

>If you lend to Allah a good loan, He will multiply it for you and forgive you. For Allah is Most Appreciative, Most Forbearing. (17)

## Surah Talaq

>Allah is the One Who created seven heavens ˹in layers˺, and likewise for the earth. The ˹divine˺ command descends between them so you may know that Allah is Most Capable of everything and that Allah certainly encompasses all things in ˹His˺ knowledge. (12)
