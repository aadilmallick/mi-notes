# Juz 11-13

## Surah Yunus

### Summary

**verses 1 - 20**

>To Him is your return all together. Allah’s promise is ˹always˺ true. Indeed, He originates the creation then resurrects it so that He may justly reward those who believe and do good. But those who disbelieve will have a boiling drink and a painful punishment for their disbelief. (4)

Allah has made the laws of our universe for a purpose. He knew humanity would come up with the orbit of the earth around the sun as the exact duration of a year, and ordained the orbit of the moon around the earth as a month. 

> He is the One Who made the sun a radiant source and the moon a reflected light, with precisely ordained phases, so that you may know the number of years and calculation ˹of time˺. Allah did not create all this except for a purpose. He makes the signs clear for people of knowledge. (5)

The world, the universe, the laws of physics and how it works are all so wondrous. Isn't that then a sign of God?

>Surely in the alternation of the day and the night, and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are truly signs for those mindful ˹of Him˺. (6)

The point of life is to not be deluded by this temporary body and earth we inhabit. Being worldly is a sin because it means we are failing the test. 

For whom is hell meant? It is for those who have forgotten that they will have to face God; those who have contented themselves with the temporary amenities of this world as opposed to the eternal bounties of the Hereafter; those who are satisfied with the things that purely as a matter of trial they have received in this world; those who attach themselves to ungodly things to such an extent that they become completely unmindful of the realities revealed by God.

> Indeed, those who do not expect to meet Us, being pleased and content with this worldly life, and who are heedless of Our signs, they will have the Fire as a home because of what they have committed. (7-8)

**verses 10-20**

>If Allah were to hasten evil for people as they wish to hasten good, they would have certainly been doomed. But We leave those who do not expect to meet Us to wander blindly in their defiance. (11)

> Whenever someone is touched by hardship, they cry out to Us, whether lying on their side, sitting, or standing. But when We relieve their hardship, they return to their old ways as if they had never cried to Us to remove any hardship! This is how the misdeeds of the transgressors have been made appealing to them. (12)

Allah knows about the deviations of people from their holy scriptures. He knows that the religions and messages from God will be tainted by humanity, and he could have settled it an once, but he leaves the distortions in order to test us. 

>Humanity was once nothing but a single community ˹of believers˺, but then they differed. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺. (19)

God had created the present world for the sake of putting human beings to the test, and to maintain the atmosphere of testing, it is necessary to keep the reality concealed, so that people should have the opportunity to use their wisdom in both right and wrong directions.

**verses 20-30**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah points out the hypocrisy of people begging for God's help or mercy, and then after he gives it to them, they turn back to their disbelieving ways. God can give you provision or take it away.


>When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with a hardship, they swiftly devise plots against Our revelations! Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Allah is swifter in devising ˹punishment˺. Surely Our messenger-angels record whatever you devise.” (21)

>He is the One Who enables you to travel through land and sea. And it so happens that you are on ships, sailing with a favourable wind, to the passengers’ delight. Suddenly, the ships are overcome by a gale wind and those on board are overwhelmed by waves from every side, and they assume they are doomed. They cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion, “If You save us from this, we will certainly be grateful.” But as soon as He rescues them, they transgress in the land unjustly. O  humanity! Your transgression is only against your own souls. ˹There is only˺ brief enjoyment in this worldly life, then to Us is your return, and then We will inform you of what you used to do. (22-23)

Man has no control over his bounty. Whatever God gives you, he can also take away. 

>The life of this world is just like rain We send down from the sky, producing a mixture of plants which humans and animals consume. Then just as the earth looks its best, perfectly beautified, and its people think they have full control over it, there comes to it Our command by night or by day, so We mow it down as if it never flourished yesterday! This is how We make the signs clear for people who reflect. (24)

>Those who do good will have the finest reward1 and ˹even˺ more.2 Neither gloom nor disgrace will cover their faces. It is they who will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever. (26)

>As for those who commit evil, the reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. Humiliation will cover them—with no one to protect them from Allah—as if their faces were covered with patches of the night’s deep darkness. It is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. (27)

**verses 30-50**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**:In these verses Allah points out how he gave hearing and sight to human beings and how it is impossible for a human to fabricate the Quran. 

>Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Who owns ˹your˺ hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living? And who conducts every affair?” They will ˹surely˺ say, “Allah.” Say, “Will you not then fear ˹Him˺? (31)

> It is not ˹possible˺ for this Quran to have been produced by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a confirmation of what came before, and an explanation of the Scripture. It is, without a doubt, from the Lord of all worlds. (37)

> Or do they claim, “He1 made it up!”? Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Produce one sûrah like it then, and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!” (38)

Some people are willfully deaf and blind to to the revelations, but the only one's they're hurting are themselves. 

>Some of them listen to what you say, but can you make the deaf hear even though they do not understand? And some of them look at you, but can you guide the blind even though they cannot see?1 (42-43)

>Indeed, Allah does not wrong people in the least, but it is people who wrong themselves. (44)

>On the Day He will gather them, it will be as if they had not stayed ˹in the world˺ except for an hour of a day,1 ˹as though they were only˺ getting to know one another. Lost indeed will be those who denied the meeting with Allah, and were not ˹rightly˺ guided! (45)

>He ˹is the One Who˺ gives life and causes death, and to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned. (56)

**verses 60-end**

>There is no activity you may be engaged in ˹O Prophet˺ or portion of the Quran you may be reciting, nor any deed you ˹all˺ may be doing except that We are a Witness over you while doing it. Not ˹even˺ an atom’s weight is hidden from your Lord on earth or in heaven; nor anything smaller or larger than that, but is ˹written˺ in a perfect Record. (61)

>There will certainly be no fear for the close servants of Allah, nor will they grieve. (62)

>He is the One Who has made the night for you to rest in and the day bright. Surely in this are signs for people who listen. (67)

>˹It is only˺ a brief enjoyment in this world, then to Us is their return, then We will make them taste the severe punishment for their disbelief. (70)

Allah could have made everybody a believer, but he didn't due to his divine decree of maintaining free will. Thus the prophet should not force anyone to believe because that goes against the point of free will to make someone a believer. 

> Had your Lord so willed ˹O Prophet˺, all ˹people˺ on earth would have certainly believed, every single one of them! Would you then force people to become believers? (99)

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Consider all that is in the heavens and the earth!” Yet neither signs nor warners are of any benefit to those who refuse to believe. (101)

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! The truth has surely come to you from your Lord. So whoever chooses to be guided, it is only for their own good. And whoever chooses to stray, it is only to their own loss. And I am not a keeper over you.” (108)

## Surah Hud

### Summary

**verses 1-10**

Allah knows what is in your heart, no matter how much you try to hide it.

>Indeed, they1 enfold ˹what is in˺ their hearts, ˹trying˺ to hide it from Him! But even when they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Surely He knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. (5)

Don't be of the hypocrites who cry and moan when suffering, and then boast when doing good in life. Do not be ungrateful to God for alleviating your suffering. 

>If We give people a taste of Our mercy then take it away from them, they become utterly desperate, ungrateful. But if We give them a taste of prosperity after being touched with adversity, they say, “My ills are gone,” and become totally prideful and boastful. (9-10)

To go after the luxuries of this worldly life is akin to wasting their life. You are not planting any seeds for the hereafter.

> Whoever desires ˹only˺ this worldly life and its luxuries, We will pay them in full for their deeds in this life—nothing will be left out. It is they who will have nothing in the Hereafter except the Fire. Their efforts in this life will be fruitless and their deeds will be useless. (15-16)

**verses 20-40**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah recounts the story of Noah building the ark and his son drowned and died because he was one of the disbelievers. He also recounts the stories of all the other prophets and how those civilizations refused to follow the prophets and were thus destroyed.
> - Good deeds wipe out bad deeds




>Surely those who believe, do good, and humble themselves before their Lord will be the residents of Paradise. They will be there forever. (23)

> Indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture, but differences arose regarding it. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord,1 their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺. They are truly in alarming doubt about it. (110)

> Establish prayer ˹O Prophet˺ at both ends of the day and in the early part of the night. Surely good deeds wipe out evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful. (114)

> And your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ would never destroy a society unjustly while its people were acting rightly. (117)

> Had your Lord so willed, He would have certainly made humanity one single community ˹of believers˺, but they will always ˹choose to˺ differ— (118)

> To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs the knowledge of what is hidden in the heavens and the earth. And to Him all matters are returned. So worship Him and put your trust in Him. And your Lord is never unaware of what you do. (123)

## Surah Yusuf

### Summary

**verses**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary:** Here is the story of Yusuf: his brothers pushed him into a well out of jealousy. He then got sold as a slave in Egypt. His owner's wife tried to seduce him, but his godly nature made him refuse. He then went to prison on false rape charges. He got out of prison and got a job as a dream interpreter.


>And when he reached maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward the good-doers. (22)

Premarital sex and cheating on others is evil and indecent.

>She advanced towards him, and he would have done likewise, had he not seen a sign from his Lord. This is how We kept evil and indecency away from him, for he was truly one of Our chosen servants. (24)

>Joseph prayed, “My Lord! I would rather be in jail than do what they invite me to. And if You do not turn their cunning away from me, I might yield to them and fall into ignorance.” (33)

We are very indifferent to the beautiful signs of God. If only we paid close attention.

>How many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by with indifference! (105)

## Surah Rad

### Summry

**verses 1-10**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah spends these verses detailing the signs in nature and the universe, calling us to reflect upon these signs and believe. 


>It is Allah Who has raised the heavens without pillars—as you can see—then established Himself on the Throne. He has subjected the sun and the moon, each orbiting for an appointed term. He conducts the whole affair. He makes the signs clear so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. (2)

>And on the earth there are ˹different˺ neighbouring tracts, gardens of grapevines, ˹various˺ crops, palm trees—some stemming from the same root, others standing alone. They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those who understand. (4)

Allah hears everything you think and say.

>It is the same ˹to Him˺ whether any of you speaks secretly or openly, whether one hides in the darkness of night or goes about in broad daylight. (10)

Allah will not change you or your status in life unless you take steps to change yourself.

>For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by Allah’s command. Indeed, Allah would never change a people’s state ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺. And if it is Allah’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him. (11)

>He is the One Who shows you lightning, inspiring ˹you with˺ hope and fear,1 and produces heavy clouds. (12)

>And ˹they are˺ those who endure patiently, seeking their Lord’s pleasure,1 establish prayer, donate from what We have provided for them—secretly and openly—and respond to evil with good. It is they who will have the ultimate abode (22)

> Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. And the disbelievers become prideful of ˹the pleasures of˺ this worldly life. But the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment. (26)

There is comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Those who have that comfort are the true believers.

>The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.”1 Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Indeed, Allah leaves to stray whoever He wills, and guides to Himself whoever turns to Him—those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find comfort. (27-28)

**verses 30-50**

In these verses, Allah tells us the power of the Quran and how it could even cause the dead to speak.

>If there were a recitation that could cause mountains to move, or the earth to split, or the dead to speak, ˹it would have been this Quran˺. But all matters are by Allah’s Will. (31)

Allah made us differ in our beliefs and religions as a test to see which one of us will go upon the straight path.

>Have the believers not yet realized that had Allah willed, He could have guided all of humanity? (31)

>For them is punishment in this worldly life, but the punishment of the Hereafter is truly far worse. And none can shield them from Allah. (34)

## Surah Ibrahim

### Summary

**verses 1-10**

>Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And woe to the disbelievers because of a severe torment! ˹They are˺ the ones who favour the life of this world over the Hereafter and hinder ˹others˺ from the Way of Allah, striving to make it ˹appear˺ crooked. It is they who have gone far astray. (2-3)

Allah created the world for a reason. Humanity is unimportant and he can erase us if he wills.

>Have you not seen that Allah created the heavens and the earth for a reason? If He wills, He can eliminate you and produce a new creation. And that is not difficult for Allah ˹at all˺. (19-20)

**verses 20-40**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah has subjected the seas, moon, and sun for us, yet we are still ungrateful. Allah has given us so many blessings just in daily life yet we are still ungrateful.


>And Satan will say ˹to his followers˺ after the judgment has been passed, “Indeed, Allah has made you a true promise. I too made you a promise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me. Indeed, I denounce your previous association of me with Allah ˹in loyalty˺. Surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.” (22)

>Tell My believing servants to establish prayer and donate from what We have provided for them—openly and secretly—before the arrival of a Day in which there will be no ransom or friendly connections. (31)

All these things are so wonderful that they should shake a man and should overwhelm him with feelings of submission to God. In spite of this, why, on seeing the universe, is he not filled with wonder and why does he not tremble at the concept of the Creator of the universe? The reason for this is that man sees the universe as soon as he is born. By seeing it again and again he takes it to be an ordinary thing; he does not find any uniqueness in it, and takes it for granted.

>And He has granted you all that you asked Him for. If you tried to count Allah’s blessings, you would never be able to number them. Indeed humankind is truly unfair, ˹totally˺ ungrateful. (34)

> This ˹Quran˺ is a ˹sufficient˺ message for humanity so that they may take it as a warning and know that there is only One God, and so that people of reason may be mindful. (52)
