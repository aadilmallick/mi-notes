# Juz 17

## Surah Anbya

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

>˹The time of˺ people’s judgment has drawn near, yet they are heedlessly turning away. Whatever new reminder comes to them from their Lord, they only listen to it jokingly, with their hearts ˹totally˺ distracted. The evildoers would converse secretly, ˹saying,˺ “Is this ˹one˺ not human like yourselves? Would you fall for ˹this˺ witchcraft, even though you can ˹clearly˺ see?” (1-3)

Allah created Earth for a reason, not just on a whim.

>We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between for sport. Had We intended to take ˹some˺ amusement, We could have found it in Our presence, if that had been Our Will. (16-17)

**verses 20-40**

>He cannot be questioned about what He does, but they will ˹all˺ be questioned. (23)

Quran prophesizes the big bang discovery and how life was formed in water.

> Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were ˹once˺ one mass then We split them apart? And We created from water every living thing. Will they not then believe? (30)

>Every soul will taste death. And We test you ˹O humanity˺ with good and evil as a trial, then to Us you will ˹all˺ be returned. (35)

Do not ask Allah to hasten the day of judgement. You might just get what you wisth for.

>Humankind is made of haste. I will soon show you My signs, so do not ask Me to hasten them. (37)

**verses 40-80**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Abraham destroyed the idols and blamed it on the largest idol. The people dropped their polytheistic facade and knew that the idol couldn't have done it since it can't move or talk, showing the ridiculousness of polytheism. But they punished Abraham by throwing him into a fire. With Allah's grace, he escaped unharmed.


>In fact, We have allowed enjoyment for these ˹Meccans˺ and their forefathers for such a long time ˹that they took it for granted˺. Do they not see that We gradually reduce ˹their˺ land from its borders? Is it they who will then prevail? (44)

Hear the call to God before the day of judgement, because by then, a single milligram of punishment will feel unbearable. 

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “I warn you only by revelation.” But the deaf cannot hear the call when they are warned! If they were touched by even a breath of your Lord’s torment, they would certainly cry, “Woe to us! We have really been wrongdoers.” (45-46)

>Then they ˹quickly˺ regressed to their ˹original˺ mind-set, ˹arguing,˺ “You already know that those ˹idols˺ cannot talk.” (65)

>We ordered, “O fire! Be cool and safe for Abraham!”1 (69)

The story of Job shows us how staying steadfast to God even during adversity pays us back.

>And ˹remember˺ when Job cried out to his Lord, “I have been touched with adversity,1 and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” So We answered his prayer and removed his adversity, and gave him back his family, twice as many, as a mercy from Us and a lesson for the ˹devoted˺ worshippers. (83-84)

>And ˹remember˺ when the Man of the Whale stormed off ˹from his city˺ in a rage, thinking We would not restrain him.1 Then in the ˹veils of˺ darkness2 he cried out, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except You. Glory be to You! I have certainly done wrong.” So We answered his prayer and rescued him from anguish. And so do We save the ˹true˺ believers. (87-88)

**verses 90-end**

>˹O prophets!˺ Indeed, this religion of yours is ˹only˺ one, and I am your Lord, so worship Me ˹alone˺. Yet the people have divided it into sects. But to Us they will all return. (92-93)

>On that Day We will roll up the heavens like a scroll of writings. Just as We produced the first creation, ˹so˺ shall We reproduce it. That is a promise binding on Us. We truly uphold ˹Our promises˺! Surely, following the ˹heavenly˺ Record, We decreed in the Scriptures: “My righteous servants shall inherit the land.”1 (104-105)

## Surah Hajj

### Summary

**verses 1-10**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah assures us that the day of judgement is coming. 


Allah offers a poignant and harrowing description of the day of judgement.

>O humanity! Fear your Lord, for the ˹violent˺ quaking at the Hour is surely a dreadful thing. The Day you see it, every nursing mother will abandon what she is nursing, and every pregnant woman will deliver her burden ˹prematurely˺. And you will see people ˹as if they were˺ drunk, though they will not be drunk; but the torment of Allah is ˹terribly˺ severe. (1-2)

Allah demonstrates his power to create life.

> O humanity! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then ˹know that˺ We did create you1 from dust, then from a sperm-drop,2 then ˹developed you into˺ a clinging clot,3 then a lump of flesh—fully formed or unformed5—in order to demonstrate ˹Our power˺ to you. ˹Then˺ We settle whatever ˹embryo˺ We will in the womb for an appointed term, then bring you forth as infants, so that you may reach your prime. Some of you ˹may˺ die ˹young˺, while others are left to reach the most feeble stage of life so that they may know nothing after having known much. And you see the earth lifeless, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell, producing every type of pleasant plant. That is because Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth, He ˹alone˺ gives life to the dead, and He ˹alone˺ is Most Capable of everything. (5-6)

Although it seems eternal hellfire is a harsh, unjust punishment, it's actually just because Allah has all evidence on court. He knows who we truly are and what we deserve.

>They will be told,˺ “This is ˹the reward˺ for what your hands have done. And Allah is never unjust to ˹His˺ creation.” (10)

**verses 10-40**

The worst thing you can do to yourself is to only be faithful when good things happen to you and to relapse into disbelief when something bad happens to you. 

>And there are some who worship Allah on the verge ˹of faith˺: if they are blessed with something good, they are content with it; but if they are afflicted with a trial, they relapse ˹into disbelief˺, losing this world and the Hereafter. That is ˹truly˺ the clearest loss. (11)

>Do you not see that to Allah bow down ˹in submission˺1 all those in the heavens and all those on the earth, as well as the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and ˹all˺ living beings, as well as many humans, while many are deserving of punishment. And whoever Allah disgraces, none can honour. Surely Allah does what He wills. (18)

When sacrificing to Allah, it's about showing your piety. He knows that the meat or blood won't reach him, so instead he allows you to eat from it.

>We have made sacrificial camels ˹and cattle˺ among the symbols of Allah, in which there is ˹much˺ good for you. So pronounce the Name of Allah over them when they are lined up ˹for sacrifice˺. Once they have fallen ˹lifeless˺ on their sides, you may eat from their meat, and feed the needy—those who do not beg, and those who do. In this way We have subjected these ˹animals˺ to you so that you may be grateful. (36)

>Neither their meat nor blood reaches Allah. Rather, it is your piety that reaches Him. This is how He has subjected them to you so that you may proclaim the greatness of Allah for what He has guided you to, and give good news to the good-doers. (37)

If you are being oppressed, you have permission to fight back.

>Permission ˹to fight back˺ is ˹hereby˺ granted to those being fought, for they have been wronged.1 And Allah is truly Most Capable of helping them ˹prevail˺. ˹They are˺ those who have been expelled from their homes for no reason other than proclaiming: “Our Lord is Allah.” Had Allah not repelled ˹the aggression of˺ some people by means of others, destruction would have surely claimed monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah’s Name is often mentioned. Allah will certainly help those who stand up for Him. Allah is truly All-Powerful, Almighty. (39-40)

**verses 40-60**

God wants us to use reasoning to see the call of God and the truth behind it. 

Before God, people with eyes are those who look at things in order to learn a lesson or draw wisdom from them. Those who see things without learning a lesson from them, are blind in the eyes of God. Their seeing is like that of animals, not human beings. God has spread on the earth innumerable lesson-giving things. Among them are the ancient memorials left behind by past nations. These nations once enjoyed pomp and power, but the signs of their existence today are nothing but a few dilapidated ruins. This reminds everybody of the fate he is finally going to meet. But when people lose the mind’s eye, the eyes on the face will fail to show them anything meaningful.

>Have they not travelled throughout the land so their hearts may reason, and their ears may listen? Indeed, it is not the eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts in the chests that grow blind. (46)

**verses 60-end**

>That is because Allah causes the night to merge into the day, and the day into the night. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. (61)

Getting closer to God is the truth. 

>That is because Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth and what they invoke besides Him is falsehood, and Allah ˹alone˺ is truly the Most High, All-Great. (62)

>And He is the One Who gave you life, then will cause you to die, and then will bring you back to life. ˹But˺ surely humankind is ever ungrateful. (66)

Allah says that Muslims are the ones "who submit" and that there is no hardship in this religion. Here are the three main rituals we must adhere to in order to become closer to God:

1. Establish prayer
2. Donate to charity
3. Always be God-conscious

>Strive for ˹the cause of˺ Allah in the way He deserves, for ˹it is˺ He ˹Who˺ has chosen you, and laid upon you no hardship in the religion—the way of your forefather Abraham. ˹It is Allah˺ Who named you ‘the ones who submit’ ˹in the˺ earlier ˹Scriptures˺ and in this ˹Quran˺, so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and that you may be witnesses over humanity. So establish prayer, pay alms-tax, and hold fast to Allah. He ˹alone˺ is your Guardian. What an excellent Guardian, and what an excellent Helper! (78)
