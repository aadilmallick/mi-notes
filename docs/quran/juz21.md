# Juz 21

## Surah ankabut

### Summary

**verses 1-10**

> Do people think once they say, “We believe,” that they will be left without being put to the test? **We certainly tested those before them. And ˹in this way˺ Allah will clearly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are liars.** (2-3)

>Whoever hopes for the meeting with Allah, ˹let them know that˺ Allah’s appointed time is sure to come. He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. (5) 

Striving in the cause of Allah strengthens our own souls. 

>And whoever strives ˹in Allah’s cause˺, only does so for their own good. Surely Allah is not in need of ˹any of˺ His creation. (6)

>As for those who believe and do good, We will certainly absolve them of their sins, and reward them according to the best of what they used to do. (7)

> We have commanded people to honour their parents. But if they urge you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of,1 then do not obey them. To Me you will ˹all˺ return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do. (8)

**verses 10-20**

> There are some who say, “We believe in Allah,” but when they suffer in the cause of Allah, they mistake ˹this˺ persecution at the hands of people for the punishment of Allah. But when victory comes from your Lord, they surely say ˹to the believers˺, “We have always been with you.” Does Allah not know best what is in the hearts of all beings? (10)

> Allah will certainly distinguish between those who have ˹sure˺ faith and the hypocrites. (11)

>Have they not seen how Allah originates the creation then resurrects it? That is certainly easy for Allah. (19)

**verses 40-end**

> Allah created the heavens and the earth for a purpose. Surely in this is a sign for the people of faith. (44)

Dhikr and prayer are tools that you can use to become more god-conscious and help you fend off indecency and wickedness. 

> Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, ˹genuine˺ prayer should deter ˹one˺ from indecency and wickedness. The remembrance of Allah is ˹an˺ even greater ˹deterrent˺. And Allah ˹fully˺ knows what you ˹all˺ do. (45)

>You ˹O Prophet˺ could not read any writing ˹even˺ before this ˹revelation˺, nor could you write at all. Otherwise, the people of falsehood would have been suspicious. (48)

This Earth is so vast and spacious that there should be no excuse to stay in a country and continue being persecuted. Emigrate for the sake of Allah.

>O My believing servants! My earth is truly spacious, so worship Me ˹alone˺. (56)

>Every soul will taste death, then to Us you will ˹all˺ be returned. (57)

>How many are the creatures that cannot secure their provisions! ˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ provides for them and you ˹as well˺. He is indeed the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. (60)

>Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills of His servants. Surely Allah has ˹full˺ knowledge of everything. (62)

The hereafter is more real compared to this worldly life. 

>This worldly life is no more than play and amusement. But the Hereafter is indeed the real life, if only they knew (64)

>As for those who struggle in Our cause, We will surely guide them along Our Way. And Allah is certainly with the good-doers. (69)

## Surah Rum

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

Allah predicted that the Romans would defeat the Iranians in an underdog matchup within 3-9 years.

>The Romans have been defeated in a nearby land.1 Yet following their defeat, they will triumph within three to nine years.1 The ˹whole˺ matter rests with Allah before and after ˹victory˺. And on that day the believers will rejoice at the victory willed by Allah. He gives victory to whoever He wills. For He is the Almighty, Most Merciful. (2-5)

Constant remembrance (through prayer, etc.) and deep contemplation lead a man towards finding God. It is by profound thought that a man finds God. In the present world, God has scattered His signs everywhere—in the human environment, in the surrounding universe and also in the teachings of the Prophet. Those who give serious consideration to these signs of God will find God. Argument in favour of God is God’s representative on earth. If rightful argument is presented to a man and he ignores it, it is as if he has ignored God Himself.

> They ˹only˺ know the worldly affairs of this life, but are ˹totally˺ oblivious to the Hereafter. Have they not reflected upon their own being? Allah only created the heavens and the earth and everything in between for a purpose and an appointed term. Yet most people are truly in denial of the meeting with their Lord! (7-8)

>It is Allah Who originates the creation, and will resurrect it. And then to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned. (11)

**verses 20-40**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah illustrates the many obvious signs he created in nature yet we take for granted.


The Universe in all the elements of its existence is the sign of God. Its coming into existence from nothingness and the enormous variety found in it indicates His vast powers. The revival of greenery on earth after its being dry and barren demonstrates re-creation and resurrection. All these are the signs of God. But these signs are only for those who lend their ears to the silent call of the Universe—for those who put their wisdom and their knowledge to the correct use.

>And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your languages and colours. Surely in this are signs for those of ˹sound˺ knowledge. (22)

>And one of His signs is that He shows you lightning, inspiring ˹you with˺ hope and fear.1 And He sends down rain from the sky, reviving the earth after its death. Surely in this are signs for people who understand. (22-24)

>And He is the One Who originates the creation then will resurrect it—which is even easier for Him.1 To Him belong the finest attributes in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Almighty, All-Wise. (27)

>When people are touched with hardship, they cry out to their Lord, turning to Him ˹alone˺. But as soon as He gives them a taste of His mercy, a group of them associates ˹others˺ with their Lord ˹in worship˺, becoming ungrateful for whatever ˹favours˺ We have given them. So enjoy yourselves, for soon you will know. (33-34)

The wrongdoers are the ones who listen to that voice in their head telling them to follow their desires. Humanity must rise above their base desires.

> In fact, the wrongdoers merely follow their desires with no knowledge. Who then can guide those Allah has left to stray? They will have no helpers. (29)

The straight path is to adhere to Allah's commandments. Do not deviate from this path.

> So be steadfast in faith in all uprightness ˹O Prophet˺—the natural Way of Allah which He has instilled in ˹all˺ people. Let there be no change in this creation of Allah. That is the Straight Way, but most people do not know. (30)

>If We give people a taste of mercy, they become prideful ˹because˺ of it. But if they are afflicted with an evil for what their hands have done, they instantly fall into despair. (36)

> Have they not seen that Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills? Surely in this are signs for people who believe. So give your close relatives their due, as well as the poor and the ˹needy˺ traveler. That is best for those who seek the pleasure of Allah,1 and it is they who will be successful. (37-38)

>Whatever loans you give, ˹only˺ seeking interest at the expense of people’s wealth1 will not increase with Allah. But whatever charity you give, ˹only˺ seeking the pleasure of Allah—it is they whose reward will be multiplied. (39)

**verses 40-end**

>See then the impact of Allah’s mercy: how He gives life to the earth after its death! Surely That ˹same God˺ can raise the dead. For He is Most Capable of everything. (50)

>So you ˹O Prophet˺ certainly cannot make the dead hear ˹the truth˺. Nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and walk away. Nor can you lead the blind out of their misguidance. You can make none hear ˹the truth˺ except those who believe in Our revelations, ˹fully˺ submitting ˹to Allah˺. (52-53)

> It is Allah Who created you in a state of weakness, then developed ˹your˺ weakness into strength, then developed ˹your˺ strength into weakness and old age.1 He creates whatever He wills. For He is the All-Knowing, Most Capable. (54)

> And on the Day the Hour will arrive, the wicked will swear that they did not stay ˹in this world˺ more than an hour. In this way they were always deluded ˹in the world˺. (55)

## Surah Luqman

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

> And We have commanded people to ˹honour˺ their parents. Their mothers bore them through hardship upon hardship, and their weaning takes two years. So be grateful to Me and your parents. To Me is the final return. But if they pressure you to associate with Me what you have no knowledge of,1 do not obey them. Still keep their company in this world courteously, and follow the way of those who turn to Me ˹in devotion˺. Then to Me you will ˹all˺ return, and then I will inform you of what you used to do. (14)

Allah is the most subtle, the most acknowledging. He surely recognizes every good deed you do.

> ˹Luqmân added,˺ “O my dear son! ˹Even˺ if a deed were the weight of a mustard seed—be it ˹hidden˺ in a rock or in the heavens or the earth—Allah will bring it forth. Surely Allah is Most Subtle, All-Aware. (16)

This is all you need to be a true believer: 

1. Pray to God
2. Encourage good, forbid evil
3. Endure patiently through suffering
4. Do not be arrogant or boastful

> “O my dear son! Establish prayer, encourage what is good and forbid what is evil, and endure patiently whatever befalls you. Surely this is a resolve to aspire to. (17)

>“And do not turn your nose up to people, nor walk pridefully upon the earth. Surely Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful. Be moderate in your pace. And lower your voice, for the ugliest of all voices is certainly the braying of donkeys.” (18-19)

>Have you not seen that Allah has subjected for you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and has lavished His favours upon you, both seen and unseen? ˹Still˺ there are some who dispute about Allah without knowledge, or guidance, or an enlightening scripture. (20)

**verses 20-end**

>Whoever fully submits themselves to Allah and is a good-doer, they have certainly grasped the firmest hand-hold. And with Allah rests the outcome of ˹all˺ affairs. (22)

>But whoever disbelieves, do not let their disbelief grieve you ˹O Prophet˺. To Us is their return, and We will inform them of all they did. Surely Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart. (23)

> We allow them enjoyment for a little while, then ˹in time˺ We will force them into a harsh torment. (24)

>The creation and resurrection of you ˹all˺ is as simple ˹for Him˺ as that of a single soul. Surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing. (28)

>That is because Allah ˹alone˺ is the Truth and what they invoke besides Him is falsehood, and ˹because˺ Allah ˹alone˺ is the Most High, All-Great. (30)

There will come a time where nobody can help you on the day of judgement, so before then, follow Allah's commandments.

> O humanity! Be mindful of your Lord, and beware of a Day when no parent will be of any benefit to their child, nor will a child be of any benefit to their parent. Surely Allah’s promise is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you, nor let the Chief Deceiver1 deceive you about Allah (33)

> Indeed, Allah ˹alone˺ has the knowledge of the Hour. He sends down the rain,1 and knows what is in the wombs.2 No soul knows what it will earn for tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land it will die. Surely Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. (34)

## Surah Sajdah

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

>The revelation of this Book is—beyond doubt—from the Lord of all worlds. (2)

>And He gave you hearing, sight, and intellect. ˹Yet˺ you hardly give any thanks. (9)

Allah didn't make everybody a born muslim from the start for a reason: he is testing us.

> Had We willed, We could have easily imposed guidance on every soul. But My Word will come to pass: I will surely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together. So taste ˹the punishment˺ for neglecting the meeting of this Day of yours. We ˹too˺ will certainly neglect you. And taste the torment of eternity for what you used to do! (12-13)\

Allah says that the true believers are the ones abandon their beds despite their sleepiness to pray to God and also donate with a free hand. Paradise is unimaginably magnificent, and it will be a reward only for the pure-hearted believers.

>The only ˹true˺ believers in Our revelation are those who—when it is recited to them—fall into prostration and glorify the praises of their Lord and are not too proud. (15)

>They abandon their beds, invoking their Lord with hope and fear, and donate from what We have provided for them. (16)

>No soul can imagine what delights are kept in store for them as a reward for what they used to do. (17)

**verses 20-end**

>But as for those who are rebellious, the Fire will be their home. Whenever they try to escape from it, they will be forced back into it, and will be told, “Taste the Fire’s torment, which you used to deny.” We will certainly make them taste some of the minor torment ˹in this life˺ before the major torment ˹of the Hereafter˺, so perhaps they will return ˹to the Right Path˺. (20-21)

It's worse to disbelieve and ignore God's message after belief because now you had your chance, but arrogance ruined you.

> And who does more wrong than the one who is reminded of Allah’s revelations then turns away from them? We will surely inflict punishment upon the wicked. (22)
