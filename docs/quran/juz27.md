# Juz 27

## Surah Dhariyat

### Summary

>Indeed, what you are promised is true. And the Judgment will certainly come to pass. (5-6)

>Surely you are ˹lost˺ in conflicting views ˹regarding the truth˺. Only those ˹destined to be˺ deluded are turned away from it. (8-9)

The righteous believers are those who pray Fajr and tahajjud, sacrificing their sleep for the hereafter.

>Indeed, the righteous will be amid Gardens and springs, ˹joyfully˺ receiving what their Lord will grant them. Before this ˹reward˺ they were truly good-doers ˹in the world˺: they used to sleep only little in the night, and pray for forgiveness before dawn. And in their wealth there was a rightful share ˹fulfilled˺ for the beggar and the poor. (15-19)

>There are ˹countless˺ signs on earth for those with sure faith, as there are within yourselves. Can you not see? In heaven is your sustenance and whatever you are promised. (20-22)

This proves the expansion of the universe. Literally ‘We are broadening the sky.’ This statement refers perhaps to that characteristic of the universe which has been only recently discovered, i.e. continuous expansion of the universe on all sides after the Big Bang. This expansion is proof of the fact that a Creator has created it, because this expansion means that it was initially in a contracted condition. According to the known laws governing matter, all the parts of the initial cosmic ball were attracted inwards. Then there was an explosion—the Big Bang—after which all matter started moving outwards. In view of this law, their movement towards the outside (or the Big Bang) could not have taken place without some external intervention. And once external intervention has been accepted, acceptance of God necessarily follows.

>We built the universe with ˹great˺ might, and We are certainly expanding ˹it˺. (47)

>And We created pairs of all things1 so perhaps you would be mindful. (49)

The purpose of life is to worship God and grow closer to them.

> I did not create jinn and humans except to worship Me. I seek no provision from them, nor do I need them to feed Me. (56-57)

## Surah Tur

>˹They will be told,˺ “This is the Fire which you used to deny. Is this magic, or do you not see? Burn in it! It is the same whether you endure ˹it˺ patiently or not.1 You are only rewarded for what you used to do.” (14-16)

People would still doubt God and dismiss it as magic even if were to bring down the most compelling and obvious signs.

>If they were to see a ˹deadly˺ piece of the sky fall down ˹upon them˺, still they would say, “˹This is just˺ a pile of clouds.” (44)

## Surah Najm

Allah knows which are the righteous people from when they are born: those who avoid major sins and shameful deeds and repent on minor sins.

>To Allah ˹alone˺ belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth so that He may reward the evildoers according to what they did, and reward the good-doers with the finest reward—those who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, despite ˹stumbling on˺ minor sins. Surely your Lord is infinite in forgiveness. He knew well what would become of you as He created you from the earth1 and while you were ˹still˺ fetuses in the wombs of your mothers.2 So do not ˹falsely˺ elevate yourselves. He knows best who is ˹truly˺ righteous. (31-32)

>˹They state˺ that no soul burdened with sin will bear the burden of another, and that each person will only have what they endeavoured towards, and that ˹the outcome of˺ their endeavours will be seen ˹in their record˺, then they will be fully rewarded, and that to your Lord ˹alone˺ is the ultimate return ˹of all things˺. (38-42)

Allah brings about everything in opposites: life and death, joy and sadness.

>Moreover, He is the One Who brings about joy and sadness. And He is the One Who gives life and causes death. (43-44)

>And He is the One Who enriches and impoverishes. (48)

>Do you find this revelation astonishing, laughing ˹at it˺ and not weeping ˹in awe˺, while persisting in heedlessness? Instead, prostrate to Allah and worship ˹Him alone˺! (59-62)

## Surah Qamar

>They rejected ˹the truth˺ and followed their own desires—and every matter will be settled—even though the stories ˹of destroyed nations˺ that have already come to them are a sufficient deterrent. ˹This Quran is˺ profound ˹in˺ wisdom, but warnings are of no benefit ˹to them˺. (3-5)

>And We have certainly made the Quran easy to remember. So is there anyone who will be mindful? (17)

>Indeed, We have created everything, perfectly preordained. Our command1 is but a single word,2 done in the blink of an eye. (49-50)

## Surah Rahman


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Surah Rahman is an interesting surah listing all the favors and blessings that God has given to humanity, and every other verse is the same statement: "Then which of your Lord’s favours will you both deny?" This shows how even though God has given us so much, we are still ungrateful.


>Every being on earth is bound to perish. (26)

>All those in the heavens and the earth are dependent on Him. Day in and day out He has something to bring about. (29)

>O  assembly of jinn and humans! If you can penetrate beyond the realms of the heavens and the earth, then do so. ˹But˺ you cannot do that without ˹Our˺ authority. (33)

If you are good in the previous life, you will be rewarded with goodness in the hereafter

>Is there any reward for goodness except goodness? (60)



## Surah Waqiah

Nothing miraculous is done through our own efforts and abilities. It is all Allah.

>Have you considered what you ejaculate? Is it you who create ˹a child out of˺ it, or is it We Who do so? (58-59)

Death will befall all of us, and transformations like dementia or being disabled or losing limbs will happen to us.

>We have ordained death for ˹all of˺ you, and We cannot be prevented from transforming and recreating you in forms unknown to you. (60-61)

>Have you considered the water you drink? Is it you who bring it down from the clouds, or is it We Who do so? If We willed, We could make it salty. Will you not then give thanks? (68-70)

Allah is allowed to swear on any of his creations, like stars, but humans can only swear on Allah. Allah swears upon the stars that the Quran is a revelation from God.

>So I do swear by the positions of the stars—and this, if only you knew, is indeed a great oath—that this is truly a noble Quran, in a well-preserved Record, touched by none except the purified ˹angels˺. (75-79)

>˹It is˺ a revelation from the Lord of all worlds. How can you then take this message lightly, and repay ˹Allah for˺ your provisions with denial?1 (80-82)



## Surah Hadid

>Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah, for He is the Almighty, All-Wise. To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. And He is Most Capable of everything. He is the First and the Last, the Most High and Most Near,1 and He has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of all things. (1-3)

Donate to charity and poor people, and Allah will pay you back 10 times over.

>Believe in Allah and His Messenger, and donate from what He has entrusted you with. So those of you who believe and donate will have a mighty reward. (7)

>Indeed, those men and women who give in charity and lend to Allah a good loan will have it multiplied for them, and they will have an honourable reward.1 (18)

Mankind thinks that the worldly life it is his everything. But, afterwards, when he is taken back to God, it will be evident to him that the glories of the world were valueless. The parable Allah gives is that you delight in seeing your plants grow, but it's not like they'll be alive forever, right? The plants eventually wither and die and it'll make you think, "what was the point of planting it in the first place?"

> Know that this worldly life is no more than play, amusement, luxury, mutual boasting, and competition in wealth and children. This is like rain that causes plants to grow, to the delight of the planters. But later the plants dry up and you see them wither, then they are reduced to chaff. And in the Hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure of Allah, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment. (20)

>˹So˺ compete with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. This is the favour of Allah. He grants it to whoever He wills. And Allah is the Lord of infinite bounty. (21)



The receiving of things in the world or the losing of them is purely for the purpose of putting man to the test. Almighty God has settled in advance what shape man’s test-paper should take. A man should pay real attention not to what he has received or what has been taken away from him, but to how he reacted on each of these occasions. The correct and required reaction is that a man should not be disheartened if he suffers some loss, nor should he develop feelings of pride and vanity if he gains something.

>No calamity ˹or blessing˺ occurs on earth or in yourselves without being ˹written˺ in a Record before We bring it into being. This is certainly easy for Allah. ˹We let you know this˺ so that you neither grieve over what you have missed nor boast over what He has granted you. For Allah does not like whoever is arrogant, boastful—those who are stingy and promote stinginess among people. And whoever turns away ˹should know that˺ Allah ˹alone˺ is truly the Self-Sufficient, Praiseworthy. (22-24)

Monasticism is an innovation and not required in religion. It's done to seek the pleasure of Allah.

>Then in the footsteps of these ˹prophets˺, We sent Our messengers, and ˹after them˺ We sent Jesus, son of Mary, and granted him the Gospel, and instilled compassion and mercy into the hearts of his followers. As for monasticism, they made it up—We never ordained it for them—only seeking to please Allah, yet they did not ˹even˺ observe it strictly. So We rewarded those of them who were faithful. But most of them are rebellious. (27)
