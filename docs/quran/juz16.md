# Juz 16

## Surah Kahf

### Summary

**verses 1-30**

God has made the pleasures of the world enticing as a test to see who will prefer the worldly life over following God's commandments, and he assures the worldly life is temporary and its pleasures will eventually be barren.

>We have indeed made whatever is on earth as an adornment for it, in order to test which of them is best in deeds. And We will certainly reduce whatever is on it to barren ground. (7-8)

>That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever Allah guides is truly guided. But whoever He leaves to stray, you will never find for them a guiding mentor. (17)

People made these kinds of arguments about the youths in the cave, which go against the essence of religion because it's discussing unimportant manners that don't improve our worship of God.

>Some will say, “They were three, their dog was the fourth,” while others will say, “They were five, their dog was the sixth,” ˹only˺ guessing blindly. And others will say, “They were seven and their dog was the eighth.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “My Lord knows best their ˹exact˺ number. Only a few people know as well.” So do not argue about them except with sure knowledge,1 nor consult any of those ˹who debate˺ about them. (22)

>And patiently stick with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure.1 Do not let your eyes look beyond them, desiring the luxuries of this worldly life. And do not obey those whose hearts We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follow ˹only˺ their desires and whose state is ˹total˺ loss. (28)

**verses 30-50**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah's next story is about a man who boasts about his garden, thinking that it will never go away. But Allah reduced his garden to ashes as a punishment for his hubris.

>If only you had said, upon entering your property, ‘This is what Allah has willed! There is no power except with Allah!’ Even though you see me inferior to you in wealth and offspring, (39)


>And give them a parable of this worldly life. ˹It is˺ like the plants of the earth, thriving when sustained by the rain We send down from the sky. Then they ˹soon˺ turn into chaff scattered by the wind. And Allah is fully capable of ˹doing˺ all things. (45)

>Wealth and children are the adornment of this worldly life, but the everlasting good deeds are far better with your Lord in reward and in hope (46)

Allah lays out how the day of judgement will happen.

>They will be presented before your Lord in rows, ˹and the deniers will be told,˺ “You have surely returned to Us ˹all alone˺ as We created you the first time, although you ˹always˺ claimed that We would never appoint a time for your return.” And the record ˹of deeds˺ will be laid ˹open˺, and you will see the wicked in fear of what is ˹written˺ in it. They will cry, “Woe to us! What kind of record is this that does not leave any sin, small or large, unlisted?” They will find whatever they did present ˹before them˺. And your Lord will never wrong anyone. (48-49)

**verses 50-70**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah's next story is about how He set up a meeting with Moses and the most knowledgeable man in the world. Moses gets increasingly impatient and doesn't see the divine knowledge that the man obtained from Allah, and the moral of the story is that God has knowledge of the unseen we cannot comprehend, but his morality and reasoning is just.

> We have surely set forth in this Quran every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people, but humankind is the most argumentative of all beings. (54)

> And who does more wrong than those who, when reminded of their Lord’s revelations, turn away from them and forget what their own hands have done? We have certainly cast veils over their hearts—leaving them unable to comprehend this ˹Quran˺—and deafness in their ears. And if you ˹O Prophet˺ invite them to ˹true˺ guidance, they will never be ˹rightly˺ guided. (57)

>Your Lord is the All-Forgiving, Full of Mercy. If He were to seize them ˹immediately˺ for what they commit, He would have certainly hastened their punishment. But they have an appointed time, from which they will find no refuge. (58)

>And how can you be patient with what is beyond your ˹realm of˺ knowledge?” (68)

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Shall we inform you of who will be the biggest losers of deeds? ˹They are˺ those whose efforts are in vain in this worldly life, while they think they are doing good!” (103-104)

## Surah Maryam

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah gave Zachariah and his wife a child named Yahya (John).

It is said that once during John’s childhood, some children asked him to come and play with them. He refused and said, ‘We have not been created for this.’ This shows that from his very childhood he was conscious that life should be purposeful. Sensitive by nature and possessed of a feeling heart, he was free of psychological complexes. He scrupulously fulfilled his duties to his parents and was completely devoid of arrogance or willfulness. These are the qualities that give man the ability never to diverge from the path of God’s Book. It is the possessor of such qualities who is showered with God’s mercy in this world and in the life hereafter.

>Peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day of his death, and the day he will be raised back to life! (15)

Neglecting prayer and following lust are the two evil deeds that will send you to hellfire. A distinctive trait of those whose characters are moulded by the preaching of the prophets, is that they are no longer slaves of their base desires but rise above them. They turn into individuals who always remember God; indeed, the essence of religion is remembrance of God, the organized expression of which is prayer (salat).

Do not follow your base desires above following and remembering God.

Those who strive for the life Hereafter, do not immediately receive the fruits of their labours and sacrifices. For this reason, they may have misgivings that this is a path of pointless endeavour. But this is a mere misunderstanding. The fact is that, just as those who devote their efforts to worldly affairs achieve corresponding results, so also will those who strive for the life of the Hereafter be requited in full measure. Nobody need harbour any doubts about this.

> But they were succeeded by generations who neglected prayer and followed their lusts and so will soon face the evil consequences. (59)

>Yet ˹some˺ people ask ˹mockingly˺, “After I die, will I really be raised to life again?” Do ˹such˺ people not remember that We created them before, when they were nothing? (66-67)

The main goal in life is to earn Allah's love.

> As for those who believe and do good, the Most Compassionate will ˹certainly˺ bless them with ˹genuine˺ love. (96)

## Surah Taha

### Summary

**verses 1-80**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah recounts the story of Moses.

The Pharoah's magicians immediately recognized that Moses was a prophet of God and submitted themselves to the Lord of all worlds, not even fearing death. Allah turned Moses' staff into a snake, which the magicians knew was a sign of God.

The magicians realize that the Pharoah only has authority in this worldly life and will not in the hereafter.

>So the magicians fell down in prostration, declaring, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.” Pharaoh threatened, “How dare you believe in him before I give you permission? He must be your master who taught you magic. I will certainly cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. You will really see whose punishment is more severe and more lasting.” They responded, “By the One Who created us! We will never prefer you over the clear proofs that have come to us. So do whatever you want! Your authority only covers the ˹fleeting˺ life of this world. Indeed, we have believed in our Lord so He may forgive our sins and that magic you have forced us to practice. And Allah is far superior ˹in reward˺ and more lasting ˹in punishment˺.” (70-73)

**verses 100-110**

The day of judgement will make your worldly life seem like nothing in comparison. All the years you spent living in the world will seem like only a few days. 

>˹Beware of˺ the Day the Trumpet will be blown,1 and We will gather the wicked on that Day blue-faced ˹from horror and thirst˺. They will whisper among themselves, “You stayed no more than ten days ˹on the earth˺.” We know best what they will say—the most reasonable of them will say, “You stayed no more than a day.” (102-104)

Adam ate the apple, and is now destined to fight against Satan on Earth. We are now supposed to seek out God's guidance and become one of those who see instead of the blind.

> Allah said, “Descend, both of you, from here together ˹with Satan˺ as enemies to each other. Then when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray ˹in this life˺ nor suffer ˹in the next˺. But whoever turns away from My Reminder will certainly have a miserable life,1 then We will raise them up blind on the Day of Judgment. They will cry, “My Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, although I used to see?” Allah will respond, “It is so, just as Our revelations came to you and you neglected them, so Today you are neglected.” (123-126)

>Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord ˹O Prophet˺ and a term already set, their ˹instant˺ doom would have been inevitable. So be patient ˹O Prophet˺ with what they say. And glorify the praises of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset, and glorify Him in the hours of the night and at both ends of the day, so that you may be pleased ˹with the reward˺. (129-130)
