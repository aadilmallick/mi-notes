# Juz 25

## Surah Fussilat

### Summary

**verses 1-30**

>So We sent against them a furious wind,1 for ˹several˺ miserable days, to make them taste a humiliating punishment in this worldly life. But far more humiliating will be the punishment of the Hereafter. And they will not be helped. (16)

Your body has a perfect record of everything you have ever done. Expect it to testify against you on the day of judgement.

>They will ask their skin ˹furiously˺, “Why have you testified against us?” It will say, “We have been made to speak by Allah, Who causes all things to speak. He ˹is the One Who˺ created you the first time, and to Him you were bound to return. (20)

>You did not ˹bother to˺ hide yourselves from your ears, eyes, and skin to prevent them from testifying against you. Rather, you assumed that Allah did not know much of what you used to do. (21)

Don't make the mistake of thinking Allah will let you out of hellfire if you endure it patiently or ask for forgiveness. Once you're there, you'll never leave.

>Even if they endure patiently, the Fire will ˹always˺ be their home. And if they ˹beg to˺ appease ˹their Lord˺, they will never be allowed to. (24)

**verses 30-40**

>And whose words are better than someone who calls ˹others˺ to Allah, does good, and says, “I am truly one of those who submit.”?1 (33)

When preaching to others, be patient with them. This is a beautiful yet difficult virtue to achieve.

>Good and evil cannot be equal. Respond ˹to evil˺ with what is best, then the one you are in a feud with will be like a close friend. But this cannot be attained except by those who are patient and who are truly fortunate. (34-35)

>And among His signs is that you see the earth devoid of life, but as soon as We send down rain upon it, it begins to stir ˹to life˺ and swell. Indeed, the One Who revives it can easily revive the dead. He is certainly Most Capable of everything. (39)

**verses 40-50**

The Quran is a beautiful and undeniable proof of God.

>Indeed, those who deny the Reminder1 after it has come to them ˹are doomed˺, for it is truly a mighty Book. It cannot be proven false from any angle. ˹It is˺ a revelation from the ˹One Who is˺ All-Wise, Praiseworthy. (41-42)

>Had We revealed it as a non-Arabic Quran, they would have certainly argued, “If only its verses were made clear ˹in our language˺. What! A non-Arabic revelation for an Arab audience!” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “It is a guide and a healing to the believers. As for those who disbelieve, there is deafness in their ears and blindness to it ˹in their hearts˺. It is as if they are being called from a faraway place.”1 (44)

When distortions appear in the scripture, Allah could settle the issue at once and make the believers a monolith, but he chooses to let these divisions happen as a test to humanity.

>Indeed, We had given Moses the Scripture, but differences arose regarding it. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord,1 their differences would have been settled ˹at once˺. They are truly in alarming doubt about it. (45)

> Whoever does good, it is to their own benefit. And whoever does evil, it is to their own loss. Your Lord is never unjust to ˹His˺ creation. (46)

Allah points out the hypocrisy of people always praying for something good to happen to them, but then they stop belief if they're touched with suffering. And once their suffering stops, they think they deserved to be healed and that God didn't alleviate their suffering for them.

The moral of the story is to follow these two principles:
1. When afflicted with suffering, do not lose hope. Keep praying to God to alleviate your suffering
2. When relieved from suffering, do not become arrogant and stop praying to God. 

>One never tires of praying for good. And if touched with evil, they become desperate and hopeless. (49)

>And if We let them taste a mercy from Us after being touched with adversity, they will certainly say, “This is what I deserve. I do not think the Hour will ˹ever˺ come. And if in fact I am returned to my Lord, the finest reward with Him will definitely be mine.” But We will surely inform the disbelievers of what they used to do. And We will certainly make them taste a harsh torment. (50)

>When We show favour to someone, they turn away, acting arrogantly. And when touched with evil, they make endless prayers ˹for good˺. (51)

>We will show them Our signs in the universe and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that this ˹Quran˺ is the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is a Witness over all things? (52)

## Surah AshShura

### Summary

**verses 1-20**


> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: The heavens burst in awe of Allah. Allah talks about how he could have made everybody on Earth muslims, and he could have settled issues and prevented sects from forming among the people of the book, but he already decreed division and confusion as a test.

>The heavens nearly burst, one above the other, ˹in awe of Him˺. And the angels glorify the praises of their Lord, and seek forgiveness for those on earth. Surely Allah alone is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (5)

> Had Allah willed, He could have easily made all ˹humanity˺ into a single community ˹of believers˺. But He admits into His mercy whoever He wills. And the wrongdoers will have no protector or helper. (8)

>They did not split ˹into sects˺ out of mutual envy until knowledge came to them.1 Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord for an appointed term,2 the matter would have certainly been settled between them ˹at once˺. And surely those who were made to inherit the Scripture3 after them are truly in alarming doubt about this ˹Quran˺. (14)

Anybody disputing about unnecessary stuff about the day of judgement like "is Gog and Magog 6 foot 5" or some other dumb shit like that are missing the point. Don't dispute about the day of judgement or deny its existence.

>Those who disbelieve in it ˹ask to˺ hasten it ˹mockingly˺. But the believers are fearful of it, knowing that it is the truth. Surely those who dispute about the Hour have gone far astray. (18)

**verses 20-30**

Whoever desires the worldly life will have their share of worldly pleasures but nothing in the hereafter.

> Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase their harvest. And whoever desires ˹only˺ the harvest of this world, We will give them some of it, but they will have no share in the Hereafter. (20)

>Had Allah given abundant provisions to ˹all˺ His servants, they would have certainly transgressed throughout the land. But He sends down whatever He wills in perfect measure. He is truly All-Aware, All-Seeing of His servants. (27)

Allah is here alluding to the possible existence of aliens (not mexicans).

>And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all living beings He dispersed throughout both. And He is Most Capable of bringing all together whenever He wills. (29)

When we sin, we destroy our own soul. If he were to destroy us as soon as we win, we probably would've died as teenagers. He pardons many of our sins.

>Whatever affliction befalls you is because of what your own hands have committed. And He pardons much. (30)

**verses 30-40**

> [!NOTE] 
> **Summary**: Allah says that the true believers realize that this life is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment. The true believers trust in the hereafter, and they have these qualities:
> - avoid major sins
> - avoid shameful deeds
> - forgive when angered
> - establish prayer
> - do not try to cheat anybody in business transactions
> - donate freely
> - enforce justice

>Whatever ˹pleasure˺ you have been given is ˹no more than a fleeting˺ enjoyment of this worldly life. But what is with Allah is far better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord; who avoid major sins and shameful deeds, and forgive when angered; who respond to their Lord, establish prayer, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and donate from what We have provided for them; and who enforce justice when wronged. (36-39)

>The reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. But whoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, then their reward is with Allah. He certainly does not like the wrongdoers. (40)

**verses 40-50**

There is no blame on people for retaliating against invaders who have transgressed in the land. However, it's even better to endure patiently and forgive. 

>There is no blame on those who enforce justice after being wronged. Blame is only on those who wrong people and transgress in the land unjustly. It is they who will suffer a painful punishment. And whoever endures patiently and forgives—surely this is a resolve to aspire to. (41-43)

Allah is giving you one chance to believe before you die. You have that chance now. While you're alive, believe. It will be too late on judgement day.

>And whoever Allah leaves to stray will have no guide after Him. You will see the wrongdoers, when they face the torment, pleading, “Is there any way back ˹to the world˺?” (44)

> Respond to your Lord before the coming of a Day from Allah that cannot be averted. There will be no refuge for you then, nor ˹grounds for˺ denial ˹of sins˺. (47)

>It is not ˹possible˺ for a human being to have Allah communicate with them, except through inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger-angel to reveal whatever He wills by His permission. He is surely Most High, All-Wise. (51)

## Surah Zukhruf

### Summary

**verses 1-10**


> [!NOTE] 
> In this surah Allah points out the hypocrisy people have to disbelieve in Islam simply because they don't want to leave the religion of their forefathers, even if their ancestors practiced complete nonsense.


>And they argue, “Had the Most Compassionate willed, we would have never worshipped them.” They have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They do nothing but lie. (20)

Even if they have wealth and high status in this worldly life, those things won't benefit them in the next.

>Is it they who distribute your Lord’s mercy? We ˹alone˺ have distributed their ˹very˺ livelihood among them in this worldly life and raised some of them in rank above others so that some may employ others in service. ˹But˺ your Lord’s mercy is far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ they amass. (32)

Allah is so confident that the riches of the worldly life are of no benefit in the hereafter that He would have given all the disbelievers Bugattis and silver homes if it were not for the fact that everybody else would be tempted to become one huge community of disbelievers.

>Were it not that people might ˹be tempted to˺ become one community ˹of disbelievers˺, We would have supplied the homes of ˹only˺ those who disbelieve in the Most Compassionate with silver roofs and ˹silver˺ stairways to ascend, and ornaments ˹of gold˺. Yet all this is no more than a ˹fleeting˺ enjoyment in this worldly life. ˹But˺ the Hereafter with your Lord is ˹only˺ for those mindful ˹of Him˺. (33-35)

Allah likens the disbelievers to the deaf and the blind. You can't make them hear or see, no matter how hard you try.

>Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind or those clearly astray? (40)

Allah hears your evil and nasty intentions.

>Or do they think that We do not hear their ˹evil˺ thoughts and secret talks? Yes ˹We do˺! And Our messenger-angels are in their presence, recording ˹it all˺. (80)

## Surah Dukhan

### Summary

**verses 1-20**

>He ˹alone˺ is truly the All-Hearing, All-Knowing—the Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything in between, if only you had sure faith. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He ˹alone˺ gives life and causes death. ˹He is˺ your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers. (6-8)

The tyrants may have the riches of this world, but it's only temporary and soon they will have to answer for their crimes.

>˹Imagine˺ how many gardens and springs the tyrants1 left behind, as well as ˹various˺ crops and splendid residences, and luxuries which they fully enjoyed. So it was. And We awarded it ˹all˺ to another people. Neither heaven nor earth wept over them, nor was their fate delayed. (25-29)

If one ponders over the system of heaven and earth—indeed, of the entire universe, it will become clear that its creation was effected with a definite purpose.

> We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between for sport. We only created them for a purpose, but most of these ˹pagans˺ do not know. (38-39)

## Surah Jathiyah

### Summary

>Surely in ˹the creation of˺ the heavens and the earth are signs for the believers. And in your own creation, and whatever living beings He dispersed, are signs for people of sure faith. (3-4)

> This ˹Quran˺ is ˹true˺ guidance. And those who deny their Lord’s revelations will suffer the ˹worst˺ torment of agonizing pain. (11)

Again, Allah emphasizes how doing good improves your soul while doing wrong destroys your soul.

> Whoever does good, it is to their own benefit. And whoever does evil, it is to their own loss. Then to your Lord you will ˹all˺ be returned. (15)

>This ˹Quran˺ is an insight for humanity—a guide and mercy for people of sure faith. (20)

There has to be retribution against the evil things evil people have done, or else what's the point of leading a good life? The purpose of all of creation is to test humanity and punish the evildoers and reward to gooddoers.

>Or do those who commit evil deeds ˹simply˺ think that We will make them equal—in their life and after their death—to those who believe and do good? How wrong is their judgment! For Allah created the heavens and the earth for a purpose, so that every soul may be paid back for what it has committed. And none will be wronged. (21-22)

The people who take desires as God are on the wrong path. One who thinks and acts under the influence of desire has, in effect, made himself a slave to it. Man’s mind is perfectly capable of distinguishing between right and wrong. But, when he mindlessly follows his desires, he closes the door to reason.

>Have you seen ˹O Prophet˺ those who have taken their own desires as their god? ˹And so˺ Allah left them to stray knowingly, sealed their hearing and hearts, and placed a cover on their sight. Who then can guide them after Allah? Will you ˹all˺ not then be mindful? And they argue, “There is nothing beyond our worldly life. We die; others are born. And nothing destroys us but ˹the passage of˺ time.” Yet they have no knowledge ˹in support˺ of this ˹claim˺. They only speculate. (23-24)

>Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “˹It is˺ Allah ˹Who˺ gives you life, then causes you to die, then will gather you ˹all˺ on the Day of Judgment, about which there is no doubt. But most people do not know.” (26)

>As for those who believed and did good, their Lord will admit them into His mercy. That is ˹truly˺ the absolute triumph. And as for those who disbelieved, ˹they will be told,˺ “Were My revelations not recited to you, yet you acted arrogantly and were a wicked people? (30-31)
