## Books

### 1 revelation

Good deeds depend on your intentions.

>I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for."

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If a man spends on his family (with the intention of having a reward from Allah) sincerely for Allah's sake then it is a (kind of) alms-giving in reward for him.

If you do a deed with the intention of doing good for Allah, then you will be rewarded. 

>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "You will be rewarded for whatever you spend for Allah's sake even if it were a morsel which you put in your wife's mouth."

The prophet pbuh receives revelation from Gabriel. He either comes as a man and tells him straight up, or the revelation comes like a ringing of a bell. The revelation is often "heavy", with the prophet sweating after he receives revelation.

>"Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and then this state passes off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says."

Waraqa (Khadija's uncle) was an old man who was waiting for the prophesized prophet from the scripture, and he predicted that the Meccans would drive the prophet pbuh out like the same for all other prophets.

>Waraqa said, "This is the same one who keeps the secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while. 

Heraclius asked Abu Sufyan about the prophet pbuh, and was confident that the prophet is a true one.

>On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, 'O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).'
>
>(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience.
>
>(When they returned) he said, 'What already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.' The people prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius's story (in connection with his faith).

## 2 - Faith

**5 pillars of islam and basics of faith**

Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: Islam is based on (the following) five (principles):

1. To testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).
2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and perfectly.
3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity) .
4. To perform Hajj. (i.e. Pilgrimage to Mecca)
5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.

A large part of faith is "haya," or having modesty, self-respect, and shyness.

>A man asked the Prophet (ﷺ) , "What sort of deeds or (what qualities of) Islam are good?" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, 'To feed (the poor) and greet those whom you know and those whom you do not Know (See Hadith No. 27).

Here are the three best things you can do to have faith:

1. Love Allah and the propeht above all else
2. Love a person only for Allah's sake
3. Hates to revert to Atheism

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Whoever possesses the following three qualities will have the sweetness (delight) of faith:
>
>1. The one to whom Allah and His Apostle becomes dearer than anything else.
>2. Who loves a person and he loves him only for Allah's sake.
>3. Who hates to revert to Atheism (disbelief) as he hates to be thrown into the fire."



**brotherhood in faith**

A large part of faith is to treat your brothers and sisters kindly. Here is what you can do:

- Do not slander or talk harshly about any muslims.
- Do not envy your muslim brother nor wish he doesn't achieve something. Instead wish the best for him and let his happiness become your happiness.

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A Muslim is the one who avoids harming Muslims with his tongue and hands. And a Muhajir (emigrant) is the one who gives up (abandons) all what Allah has forbidden.

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "None of you will have faith till he wishes for his (Muslim) brother what he likes for himself."

**loving the prophet more than anything**

The prophet is a model for all humanity so it makes sense why we should love him above all else. He is the aspiration of what it means to serve our purpose as a human being.

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said "None of you will have faith till he loves me more than his father, his children and all mankind."

**never become complacent**

If even the prophet fears hellfire, what are we doing to ensure our place in heaven? He knows that God does not like complacency and feeling like you can predict God's behavior. Complacency is a sign of waning faith since if you had true faith you would do whatever it takes to please God.

>Whenever Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered the Muslims to do something, he used to order them deeds which were easy for them to do, (according to their strength and endurance). They said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! We are not like you. Allah has forgiven your past and future sins." So Allah's Apostle became angry and it was apparent on his face. He said, "I am the most Allah fearing, and know Allah better than all of you do."

**two muslims killing each other both go to hellfire**

Killing muslims goes against your religion obviously.

>While I was going to help this man ('Ali Ibn Abi Talib), Abu Bakra met me and asked, "Where are you going?" I replied, "I am going to help that person." He said, "Go back for I have heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the murderer as well as the murdered will go to the Hell-fire.' I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! It is all right for the murderer but what about the murdered one?' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "He surely had the intention to kill his companion."

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Abusing a Muslim is Fusuq (an evil doing) and killing him is Kufr (disbelief)."

**signs of a hypocrite**

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The signs of a hypocrite are three:
>
>1. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.
>2. Whenever he promises, he always breaks it (his promise ).
>3. If you trust him, he proves to be dishonest. (If you keep something as a trust with him, he will not return it.)"

**perfection in faith**

>"What is Ihsan (perfection)?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "To worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is looking at you."

**how to deal with vague rulings**

If there is ever a vague ruling like what makes halal meat or the ruling on masturbation, leave it and stick to the strict interpretation of not allowing it, since it is better to steer clear of those doubtful things.

>I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'Both legal and illegal things are evident but in between them there are doubtful (suspicious) things and most of the people have no knowledge about them. So whoever saves himself from these suspicious things saves his religion and his honor. And whoever indulges in these suspicious things is like a shepherd who grazes (his animals) near the Hima (private pasture) of someone else and at any moment he is liable to get in it.

**jihad**

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The person who participates in (Holy battles) in Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His Apostles, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to Paradise (if he is killed in the battle as a martyr). Had I not found it difficult for my followers, then I would not remain behind any sariya going for Jihad and I would have loved to be martyred in Allah's cause and then made alive, and then martyred and then made alive, and then again martyred in His cause."

**ramadan**

>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Whoever observes fasts during the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping to attain Allah's rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven."

**moderation in faith**

Overburdening yourself in faith will make you hate it. So instead do as much as you are capable of.

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength by worshipping in the mornings, the afternoons, and during the last hours of the nights." (See Fath-ul-Bari, Page 102, Vol 1).

>Once the Prophet (ﷺ) came while a woman was sitting with me. He said, "Who is she?" I replied, "She is so and so," and told him about her (excessive) praying. He said disapprovingly, "Do (good) deeds which is within your capacity (without being overtaxed) as Allah does not get tired (of giving rewards) but (surely) you will get tired and the best deed (act of Worship) in the sight of Allah is that which is done regularly."

If you do the bare minimum in Islam, then you will go to heaven. However, it's very difficult to do a perfect prayer, so it's better to supplement with sunnah prayers.

>A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we heard his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he came near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "You have to offer prayers perfectly five times in a day and night (24 hours)." The man asked, "Is there any more (praying)?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "No, but if you want to offer the Nawafil prayers (you can)." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) further said to him: "You have to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan." The man asked, "Is there any more fasting?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "No, but if you want to observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)" Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) further said to him, "You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)." The man asked, "Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to pay?" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, "No, unless you want to give alms of your own." And then that man retreated saying, "By Allah! I will neither do less nor more than this." Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "If what he said is true, then he will be successful (i.e. he will be granted Paradise)."

## Book 3: Knowledge

**Don't pester people with religious knowledge**

The prophet always used to give short khutbahs because he didn't want to pester people continually with religious knowledge.

>The Prophet (ﷺ) used to take care of us in preaching by selecting a suitable time, so that we might not get bored. (He abstained from pestering us with sermons and knowledge all the time).

>Abdullah used to give a religious talk to the people on every Thursday. Once a man said, "O Aba Abdur-Rahman! (By Allah) I wish if you could preach us daily." He replied, "The only thing which prevents me from doing so, is that I hate to bore you, and no doubt I take care of you in preaching by selecting a suitable time just as the Prophet (ﷺ) used to do with us, for fear of making us bored."

It's important to teach islam slowly so people can get used to it.

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Facilitate things to people (concerning religious matters), and do not make it hard for them and give them good tidings and do not make them run away (from Islam).

>I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, "If Allah wants to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the religion. I am just a distributor, but the grant is from Allah. (And remember) that this nation (true Muslims) will keep on following Allah's teachings strictly and they will not be harmed by any one going on a different path till Allah's order (Day of Judgment) is established."

**envy is allowed in these two cases**

The two best people on the planet are these two people:

1. A wealthy person who donates freely
2. A wise person in religion and teaches it to others while not being hypocritical

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do not wish to be like anyone except in two cases. (The first is) A person, whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it righteously; (the second is) the one whom Allah has given wisdom (the Holy Qur'an) and he acts according to it and teaches it to others." (Fath-al-Bari page 177 Vol. 1)

**signs of the day of judgement**

>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "From among the portents of the Hour are (the following): 
>
>1. Religious knowledge will be taken away (by the death of Religious learned men).
>2. (Religious) ignorance will prevail.
>3. Drinking of Alcoholic drinks (will be very common).
>4. There will be prevalence of open illegal sexual intercourse.

**the ritual doesn't matter. It's your piety**

When people did the umrah incorrectly, the prophet didn't care, because the actual point is to show piety to God. The steps don't matter.

>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stopped (for a while near the Jimar) at Mina during his last Hajj for the people and they were asking him questions. A man came and said, "I forgot and got my head shaved before slaughtering the Hadi (sacrificing animal)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "There is no harm, go and do the slaughtering now." Then another person came and said, "I forgot and slaughtered (the camel) before Rami (throwing of the pebbles) at the Jamra." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Do the Rami now and there is no harm." The narrator added: So on that day, when the Prophet (ﷺ) was asked about anything (as regards the ceremonies of Hajj) performed before or after its due time, his reply was: "Do it (now) and there is no harm."

>Somebody said to the Prophet (during his last Hajj), "I did the slaughtering before doing the Rami.' The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned with his hand and said, "There is no harm in that." Then another person said. "I got my head shaved before offering the sacrifice." The Prophet (ﷺ) beckoned with his hand saying, "There is no harm in that."

**dont make the prayer too long**

The prophet always made congregational prayers short because people have stuff to do.

>Once a man said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I may not attend the (compulsory congregational) prayer because so and so (the Imam) prolongs the prayer when he leads us for it. The narrator added: "I never saw the Prophet (ﷺ) more furious in giving advice than he was on that day. The Prophet said, "O people! Some of you make others dislike good deeds (the prayers). So whoever leads the people in prayer should shorten it because among them there are the sick the weak and the needy (having some jobs to do).

**spread knowledge as much as possible**

>And 'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz wrote to Abu Bakr bin Hazm, "Look for the knowledge of Hadith and get it written, as I am afraid that religious knowledge will vanish and the religious learned men will pass away (die). Do not accept anything save the Hadiths of the Prophet. Circulate knowledge and teach the ignorant, for knowledge does not vanish except when it is kept secretly (to oneself)."

**your kids dying will expiate your sins**

>Some women requested the Prophet (ﷺ) to fix a day for them as the men were taking all his time. On that he promised them one day for religious lessons and commandments. Once during such a lesson the Prophet said, "A woman whose three children die will be shielded by them from the Hell fire." On that a woman asked, "If only two die?" He replied, "Even two (will shield her from the Hell-fire).

**stand up and pray**

"A well dressed soul may be naked in the hereafter" means that the only way to clad ourselves in clothing in the hereafter is to build piety and worship, which will be our clothes in the hereafter. We may have clothes in the worldly life, but that doesn't mean we'll have clothes in the hereafter.

>One night Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up and said, "Subhan Allah! How many afflictions have been descended tonight and how many treasures have been disclosed! Go and wake the sleeping lady occupants of these dwellings (his wives) up (for prayers). A well-dressed (soul) in this world may be naked in the Hereafter. "

**killing another muslim is disbelief**

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me during Hajjat-al-Wida: Let the people keep quiet and listen. Then he said (addressing the people), "Do not (become infidels) revert to disbelief after me by striking the necks (cutting the throats) of one another (killing each other).

**don't depend solely on belief**

>I was informed that the Prophet (ﷺ) had said to Muadh, "Whosoever will meet Allah without associating anything in worship with Him will go to Paradise." Muadh asked the Prophet, "Should I not inform the people of this good news?" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, "No, I am afraid, lest they should depend upon it (absolutely).

**the power of small deeds**

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A man saw a dog eating mud from (the severity of) thirst. So, that man took a shoe (and filled it) with water and kept on pouring the water for the dog till it quenched its thirst. So Allah approved of his deed and made him to enter Paradise."

**the bedouin pee story**

>A Bedouin stood up and started making water in the mosque. The people caught him but the Prophet (ﷺ) ordered them to leave him and to pour a bucket or a tumbler of water over the place where he had passed the urine. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said, "You have been sent to make things easy and not to make them difficult."

**jihad**

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A wound which a Muslim receives in Allah's cause will appear on the Day of Resurrection as it was at the time of infliction; blood will be flowing from the wound and its color will be that of the blood but will smell like musk."

## Book 4: ablution

**perform ablution correctly: save your heels from the fire**

>Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) remained behind us in a journey. He joined us while we were performing ablution for the Asr prayer which was over-due. We were just passing wet hands over our feet (not washing them properly) so the Prophet (ﷺ) addressed us in a loud voice and said twice or thrice, "Save your heels from the fire."

>'If a man performs ablution perfectly and then offers the compulsory congregational prayer, Allah will forgive his sins committed between that (prayer) and the (next) prayer till he offers it.

**Ruling on farting**

You should not leave the prayer if you fart unless you either hear or smell something.

>My uncle asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about a person who imagined to have passed wind during the prayer. Allah' Apostle replied: "He should not leave his prayers unless he hears sound or smells something."

**before having sex**

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "If anyone of you on having sexual relations with his wife said (and he must say it before starting) 'In the name of Allah. O Allah! Protect us from Satan and also protect what you bestow upon us (i.e. the coming offspring) from Satan, and if it is destined that they should have a child then, Satan will never be able to harm that offspring."

**before going to the bathroom**

>Whenever the Prophet (ﷺ) went to answer the call of nature, he used to say, "Allah-umma inni audhu bika minal khubuthi wal khaba'ith i.e. O Allah, I seek Refuge with You from all offensive and wicked things (evil deeds and evil spirits).

**cleaning private parts**

Clean private parts with left hand and not the right hand

>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Whenever anyone of you drinks water, he should not breathe in the drinking utensil, and whenever anyone of you goes to a lavatory, he should neither touch his penis nor clean his private parts with his right hand."

**what to do before sleeping**

If you do these two actions before sleeping, then if you die that night, you will die with faith.

1. Perform ablution
2. Say the dua below

>The Prophet (ﷺ) said to me, "Whenever you go to bed perform ablution like that for the prayer, lie or your right side and say, "Allahumma aslamtu wajhi ilaika, wa fauwadtu Amri ilaika, wa alja'tu Zahri ilaika raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika. La Malja'a wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta wa bina-biyika-l ladhi arsalta" (O Allah! I surrender to You and entrust all my affairs to You and depend upon You for Your Blessings both with hope and fear of You. There is no fleeing from You, and there is no place of protection and safety except with You O Allah! I believe in Your Book (the Qur'an) which You have revealed and in Your Prophet (Muhammad) whom You have sent). Then if you die on that very night, you will die with faith (i.e. or the religion of Islam). Let the aforesaid words be your last utterance (before sleep)." I repeated it before the Prophet (ﷺ) and when I reached "Allahumma amantu bikitabika-l-ladhi anzalta (O Allah I believe in Your Book which You have revealed)." I said, "Wa-rasulika (and your Apostle)." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "No, (but say): 'Wanabiyika-l-ladhi arsalta (Your Prophet whom You have sent), instead."

## Book 5: Ghusl

**the purpose of ablution**

Ablution is meant to purify you before prayer and not meant to be difficult.

>"O you who have believed, when you rise to perform prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of janabah, then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the place of relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and hands with it. Allah does not intend to make difficulty for you, but He intends to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful."

**ablution before sleep**

If you are in a state of junub (you ejaculated), then you must perform ablution before sleeping.

**praying with shoes on**

It is permissible to pray with shoes on.

>Said bin Yazid Al-Azdi: I asked Anas bin Malik whether the Prophet (ﷺ) had ever, prayed with his shoes on. He replied "Yes."
