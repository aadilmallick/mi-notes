When learning the sunnah, it is important to understand that knowledge is nothing without applying it.

> The pious predecessors defined knowledge as, “Fear that would engrave more acts of worship in a person’s heart, increase good habits and make the person more eager to apply them.”

> A person once said to another who often sought knowledge but did not practice what he learnt, “You wasted your life in collecting weapons, so, when will you fight?”

> Many people are eager, obedient and ravenous to seek knowledge, yet, they neither benefit themselves nor benefit others from it.

Many people are ravenous to learn hadith, but they never apply it. **Knowledge requires practicing it**.

The sunnah is optional, but recommended. You will not be punished for not following it.

## Best quotes

> _“The example of the one who remembers his Lord (God) in comparison with the one who does not remember his Lord is that of the living and the dead.”_

> _"Being connected with Allah is life, seeking refuge with Him is salvation, being near Him is success and satisfaction and keeping away from Him is loss and deviation." - Aisha_

> _"One should always remember Allah, as the people of paradise do not regret anything, except an hour that passed by them in this life without remembering Allah"_

## Duas

### How to make duas

Always start duas by praising Allah and then sending peace and blessings to the prophet. When asking Allah for something specific, refer to him by one of his 99 names the closest to what you are asking for, like the Ever-forgiving.

### Random duas

- Say _subhanallah wa bihamdi_ 100 times a day
- When seeing an ill person, say this dua as to not be afflicted with illness:
  > _"all praise is to Allah Who has protected me against what He has afflicted you with and Who has graced me over many of whom He has created with marked graciousness"_

## Sunnah for daily life

### Waking up

Here is what you should do after waking up:

1. Recite the **dua after minor death**
2. Recite ayat-al-kursi
3. Recite the three quls: ikhlas, falaq, naas
4. Recite this dua: *"We have become in the morning and all Kingdom is Allah’s, and all praise is to Allah. There is no god but Allah, alone, with no partner. All kingdom is His, all praise is to Him and He is Ever-Determiner over everything. O Allah, I ask You for the good of what is in this day, and the good of what is after it, and I take refuge with You from the evil of what is in this day and the evil of what is after it. My God, I take refuge with You from laziness and bad aging, and I take refuge with You from hell and grave torment"*
5. Do wudoo (wash your face and hands)

### Going to sleep

1. Do wudu as it is best to sleep in a state of wudu.
2. Dust off the bed three times, and then recite this dua:
3. When you go to bed, say alhamdulillah 33 times, subhanallah 33 times, and allahuakbar 34 times.
4. Recite ayat-al-kursi
5. Recite the four kuls (naas, falaq, iklhas, kafirun)

### Using the bathroom

When using the bathroom, you should never take any books with Allah's name written inside into the bathroom.

But here is the sunnah:

1. Enter the bathroom with the left foot
2. Say this dua: "I take refuge from Allah from all the jinn."
3. Exit the bathroom with the right foot.
4. Say "Ghufranak"

### The perfect wudu

The perfect wudu is where you clean every part of your body and you exaggerate the cleanliness.

- When washing your nose, blow it with water
- When washing your hands, wash the in-betweens of your fingers
- When washing your feet, wash the bottoms and top up to the ankle.

After completing the wudu, say this dua:

After a perfect wudu, if you pray two sunnah rakahs before a prayer, then the prophet says this:

> "He who performs ablution like this of mine and then stood up (for prayer) and offered two rak’ahs of prayer without allowing his thoughts to be distracted, all his previous sins are expiated."

> “He who performed ablution perfectly, his sins would come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails.”


> [!NOTE]
> The importance of doing a perfect wudu can't be understated. Always exaggerate the washing.

3. Recite this dua: *"There is no god but Allah, alone with no partner, all kingdom is His, all praise is to Him, and He is Ever-Determiner over everything. O Allah, there is no deterrent for what You gave, no giver for what You prevented, and neither wealth nor power can protect their owner from You"*
4. Recite this dua: *"There is no god but Allah, alone with no partner, all kingdom is His, all praise is to Him, and He is Ever-Determiner over everything. There is no might or any power except with Allah, and we do not worship any but Him, all grace is His, all favor is His and all good praise is to Him.

### Twelve sunnah prayers

The twelve sunnah prayers a day are spread before and after the fard salahs, and this is what the prophet had to say about it:
